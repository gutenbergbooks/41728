<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The completion of the second volume of my Dictionary has
been delayed from several unforeseen circumstances, the
most important being the death of my most kind and learned
friend the Rev. Dr. Gregor. The loss which folk-lore students
as a body sustained by this lamented scholar&#8217;s death, was in
my own case accentuated, not only by many years of kindly
communication, but by the very special help which he
generously gave me for this collection.</p>

<p>The second volume completes the collection of games on
the lines already laid down. It has taken much more space
than I originally intended, and I was compelled to add some
important variants to the first volume, sent to me during the
compilation of the second. I have explained in the memoir
that the two volumes practically contain all that is to be
collected, all, that is to say, of real importance.</p>

<p>The memoir seeks to show what important evidence is to
be derived from separate study of the Traditional Games of
England. That games of all classes are shown to contain
evidence of ancient custom and belief is remarkable testimony
to the anthropological methods of studying folk-lore,
which I have followed. The memoir fills a considerable
space, although it contains only the analytical portion of
what was to have been a comprehensive study of both the
analytical and comparative sides of the questions. Dr. Gregor
had kindly promised to help me with the study of foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vi" id="PageII_vi">[vi]</a></span>
parallels to British Games, but before his death it became
apparent that this branch of the subject would almost need
a separate treatise, and his death decided me to leave it
untouched. I do not underrate its importance, but I am
disposed to think that the survey I have given of the British
evidence will not be materially shaken by the study of the
comparative evidence, which will now be made the easier.</p>

<p>I ought perhaps to add, that the &#8220;Memoir&#8221; at the end of
this volume was read as a paper at the evening meeting of the
Folk Lore Society, on March 16th, 1898.</p>

<p>I have again to thank my many kind correspondents for their
help in collecting the different versions of the games.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The players form a ring by joining hands, with one child,
usually a boy, standing in the centre. The ring walks round,
singing the first four lines. At the fifth line the ring stands
still, and each child suits her actions to the words sung. At
&#8220;the farmer sows his seed,&#8221; each player pretends to scatter
seed, then they all fold their arms and &#8220;stand at ease,&#8221;
&#8220;stamp their feet,&#8221; and &#8220;clap their hands&#8221; together in order,
and finally each child turns herself round. Then they again
clasp hands and move round the centre child, who at the
words &#8220;open the ring and take one in&#8221; chooses and takes
into the ring with him one player from it. These two stand
together while the ring sings the marriage formula. At the
end the child first in the centre joins the ring; the second
child remaining in the centre, and in her turn choosing another
from the ring.</p>

<p>This is the (<a href="#OatsMWenlock">Much Wenlock</a>) way of playing. Among the
variants there are some slight differences. In the <a href="#OatsWakefield">Wakefield
version</a> (Miss Fowler), a little boy is placed in the centre of the
ring first, he chooses a girl out of the ring at the singing of the
third line and kisses her. They stand hand in hand while
the others sing the next verse. In the <a href="#OatsTean">Tean version</a> (Miss
Keary), the children turn round with their backs to the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_10" id="PageII_10">[10]</a></span>
in the centre, and stand still when singing &#8220;Waiting for a
partner.&#8221; In the <a href="#OatsHampshire">Hampshire</a> (Miss Mendham), <a href="#OatsBrigg">Brigg</a> (Miss
Barker), and <a href="#OatsWinterton">Winterton</a> (Miss Peacock) versions, the children
dance round instead of walking. The Rev. Mr. Roberts,
in a version from Kirkby-on-the-Bain (N.W. Lincolnshire),
says: &#8220;There is no proper commencement of this song.
The children begin with &#8216;A waitin&#8217; fur a pardner,&#8217; or &#8216;Oats
and beans,&#8217; just as the spirit moves them, but I think &#8216;A
waitin&#8217;&#8217; is the usual beginning here.&#8221; In a Sheffield version
sent by Mr. S. O. Addy, four young men stand in the middle
of the ring with their hands joined. These four dance round
singing the first lines. After &#8220;views his lands&#8221; these four
choose sweethearts, or partners, from the ring. The eight join
hands and sing the remaining four lines. The four young
men then join the larger ring, and the four girls remain in the
centre and choose partners next time. The words of this
version are almost identical with those of <a href="#OatsMWenlock">Shropshire</a>. In the
<a href="#OatsMan">Isle of Man version</a> (A. W. Moore), when the kiss is given all
the children forming the ring clap their hands. There is no
kissing in the <a href="#OatsMWenlock">Shropshire</a> and many other versions of this
game, and the centre child does not in all cases sing the
words.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Other versions have been sent from Winterton, Leadenham,
and Lincoln, by Miss Peacock, and from Brigg, while the
<i>Northamptonshire Notes and Queries</i>, ii. 161, gives another
by Mr. R. S. Baker. The words are practically the same as
the versions printed above from <a href="#OatsEKirkby">Lincolnshire</a> and <a href="#OatsRaunds">Northants</a>.
The words of the Madeley version are the same as the <a href="#OatsMWenlock">Much
Wenlock</a> (No. 1). The Nottingham tune (Miss Youngman),
and three others sent with the words, are the same as the
<a href="#OatsTuneMadeley">Madeley tune</a> printed above.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) This interesting game is essentially of rural origin, and
probably it is for this reason that Mr. Newell did not obtain
any version from England for his <i>Games and Songs of American
Children</i>, but his note that it &#8220;seems, strangely enough, to be
unknown in Great Britain&#8221; (p. 80), is effectually disproved by
the examples I have collected. There is no need in this case
for an analysis of the rhymes. The variants fall into three<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_11" id="PageII_11">[11]</a></span>
categories: (1) the questioning form of the words, (2) the
affirming form, and (3) the indiscriminate form, as in <a href="#OatsBoston">Nos.
xvi.</a> to <a href="#OatsWakefield">xviii.</a>, and of these I am disposed to consider the first
to represent the earliest idea of the game.</p>

<p>If the crops mentioned in the verses be considered, it will
be found that the following table represents the different

<p>The first three are the more constant words, but it is curious
that Norfolk, not a hop county, should have adopted that grain
into the game. Hops are grown there on rare occasions, and
it is probable that the game may have been introduced from
a hop county.</p>

<p>In <i>Northants Notes and Queries</i>, i. 163-164, Mr. R. S.
Baker gives a most interesting account of the game (<a href="#OatsRaunds">No. iii.</a>) as
follows:&#8212;&#8220;Having been recently invited to join the Annual
Christmas Entertainment of the Raunds Church Choir, I noticed
that a very favourite pastime of the evening was one which
I shall call &#8216;Choosing Partners.&#8217; The game is played thus:
The young men and maidens join hands indiscriminately, and
form a ring; within the ring stand a lad and a lass; then
they all step round the way the sun goes, to a plain tune.
During the singing of the two last lines [of the first part] they
all disjoin hands, stop and stamp their feet and clap their
hands and turn right round .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then join hands [while singing
the second verse]. The two in the middle at [&#8216;Open the
ring&#8217;] choose each of them a partner of the opposite sex,
which they do by pointing to the one chosen; then they continue
round, to the words [sang in next verse], the two pairs
of partners crossing hands, first right and then left, and revolving<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_12" id="PageII_12">[12]</a></span>
opposite ways alternately. The march round is
temporarily suspended for choosing partners. The partners
salute [at &#8216;Now you&#8217;re married&#8217;], or, rather, each lad kisses
his chosen lass; the first two partners go out, the game
continues as before, and every one in the ring has chosen
and been chosen, and every lad has saluted every lass. The
antiquity of the pastime is evidenced by its not mentioning
wheat; wheat was in remote times an exceptional crop&#8212;the
village people lived on oatmeal and barley bread. It also
points, possibly, to a period when most of the land lay in
grass. Portions of the open fields were cultivated, and after
a few years of merciless cropping were laid down again to
recuperate. &#8216;Helping to chop the wood&#8217; recalls the time when
coal was not known as fuel. I am indebted for the correct
words of the above to a Raunds maiden, Miss B. Finding, a
native of the village, who kindly wrote them down for me.&#8221;
Mr. Baker does not say how Miss Finding got the peculiar
spelling of this version. It would be interesting to know
whether this form of spelling was used as indicative of the
pronunciation of the children, or of the supposed antiquity of
the game. The Rev. W. D. Sweeting, also writes at the same
reference, &#8220;The same game is played at the school feast at
Maxey; but the words, as I have taken them down, vary
from those given above. We have no mention of any crop
except barley, which is largely grown in the district; and
the refrain, repeated after the second and sixth lines, is
&#8216;waiting for the harvest.&#8217; A lady suggested to me that the
two first lines of the conclusion are addressed to the bride
of the game, and the two last, which in our version run, &#8216;You
must be kind and very good,&#8217; apply to the happy swain.&#8221;</p>

<p>This interesting note not only suggests, as Mr. Baker and
Mr. Sweeting say, the antiquity of the game and its connection
with harvest at a time when the farms were all laid in open
fields, but it points further to the custom of courtship and
marriage being the outcome of village festivals and dances
held after spring sowing and harvest gatherings. It seems in
Northamptonshire not to have quite reached the stage of
the pure children&#8217;s game before it was taken note of by<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_13" id="PageII_13">[13]</a></span>
Mr. Baker, and this is an important illustration of the descent
of children&#8217;s games from customs. As soon as it has become
a child&#8217;s game, however, the process of decadence sets in.
Thus, besides verbal alterations, the lines relating to farming
have dropped out of the Wakefield version. It is abundantly
clear from the more perfect game-rhymes that the waiting for
a partner is an episode in the harvest customs, as if, when the
outdoor business of the season was finished, the domestic
element becomes the next important transaction in the year&#8217;s
proceedings. The curious four-lined formula applicable to the
duties of married life may indeed be a relic of those rhythmical
formul&aelig; which are found throughout all early legal ceremonies.
A reference to Mr. Ralston&#8217;s section on marriage songs, in his
<i>Songs of the Russian People</i>, makes it clear that marriages
in Russia were contracted at the gatherings called Besyedas
(p. 264), which were social gatherings held during October
after the completion of the harvest; and the practice is, of
course, not confined to Russia.</p>

<p>It is also probable that this game may have preserved the
tradition of a formula sung at the sowing of grain, in order to
propitiate the earth goddess to promote and quicken the growth
of the crops. Turning around or bowing to fields and lands and
pantomimic actions in imitation of those actually required, are
very general in the history of sympathetic magic among primitive
peoples, as reference to Mr. Frazer&#8217;s <i>Golden Bough</i> will
prove; and taking the rhyming formula together with the
imitative action, I am inclined to believe that in this game we
may have the last relics of a very ancient agricultural rite.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_2" id="GameII_2"></a>Obadiah</h3>

<p>The players stand in a row. The child at the head of the
row says, &#8220;My son Obadiah is going to be married, twiddle your
thumbs,&#8221; suiting the action to the word by clasping the fingers
of both hands together, and rapidly &#8220;twiddling&#8221; the thumbs.
The next child repeats both words and actions, and so on all
along the row, all the players continuing the &#8220;twiddling.&#8221;
The top child repeats the words, adding (very gravely), &#8220;Fall
on one knee,&#8221; the whole row follows suit as before (still<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_14" id="PageII_14">[14]</a></span>
twiddling their thumbs). The top child repeats from the beginning,
adding, &#8220;Do as you see me,&#8221; and the rest of the children
follow suit, as before. Just as the last child repeats the words,
the top child falls on the child next to her, and all go down
like a row of ninepins. The whole is said in a sing-song way.
This game was, so far as I can ascertain, truly East Anglian.
I have never been able to hear of it in other parts of England
or Wales.&#8212;Bexley Heath (Miss Morris). Also played in
London.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_3" id="GameII_3"></a>Odd or Even</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; game, played with buttons, marbles, and halfpence.
Peacock&#8217;s <i>Manley and Corringham Glossary</i>; also mentioned
in Brogden&#8217;s <i>Provincial Words (Lincolnshire)</i>. Mr. Patterson
says (<i>Antrim and Down Glossary</i>)&#8212;A boy shuts up a few small
objects, such as marbles, in one hand, and asks his opponent
to guess if the number is odd or even. He then either pays or
receives one, according as the guess is right or wrong. Strutt
describes this game in the same way, and says it was played
in ancient Greece and Rome. Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 147) also
mentions it.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One child sits upon a little stool. The others march
round her in single file, taking hold of each other&#8217;s frocks.
They say in a sing-song manner the first two lines, and the old
woman answers by telling them the hour. The questions and
answers are repeated until the old woman says, &#8220;It&#8217;s eleven,
and you&#8217;ll be hanged at twelve.&#8221; Then the children all run
off in different directions and the old woman runs after them.
Whoever she catches becomes old woman, and the game is
continued.&#8212;<a href="#DameYorks">Yorkshire</a> (Miss E. Cadman). In the version
given from <a href="#DameHalliwell">Halliwell</a> there is a further dialogue, it will be
seen, before the old woman chases.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The use of the Yorkshire word &#8220;beck&#8221; (&#8220;stream&#8221;) in
the <a href="#DameYorks">first variant</a> suggests that this may be the original version
from which the <a href="#DameHalliwell">&#8220;Beccles&#8221; version</a> has been adapted, a particular
place being substituted for the general. The game somewhat
resembles &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_227">Fox and Goose</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A ring is formed by children joining hands; one child,
who represents Sir Roger, lays down on the ground in the
centre of the ring with his head covered with a handkerchief.
The ring stands still and sings the verses. When the second
verse is begun, a child from the ring goes into the centre and
stands by Sir Roger, to represent the apple tree. At the fourth
verse another child goes into the ring, and pretends to pick
up the fallen apples. Then the child personating Sir Roger
jumps up and knocks the child personating the old woman,
beating her out of the ring. She goes off hobbling on one
foot, and pretending to be hurt. In the <a href="#RogerOrdsall">Ordsall game</a> the
children dance round when singing the verses instead of standing
still, the action of the game being the same. In the <a href="#RogerTong">Tong
version</a>, the action seems to be done by the ring. Miss Burne
says the children go through various movements, finally all
limping round. The <a href="#RogerNewark">Newark</a> (Notts), and <a href="#RogerBath">Bath versions</a> are
played as first described, Poor Roger being covered with a
cloak, or an apron, and laying down in the middle of the ring.
A Southampton version has additional features&#8212;the ring of
children keep their arms crossed, and lay their hands on their
chests, bending their heads and bodies backwards and forwards,
in a mourning attitude, while they sing; in addition
to which, in the <a href="#RogerBath">Bath version</a>, the child who personates the
apple tree during the singing of the third verse raises her arms
above her head, and then lets them drop to her sides to show
the falling apples.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Various as the game-rhymes are in word detail, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_23" id="PageII_23">[23]</a></span>
are practically the same in incident. One remarkable feature
stands out particularly, namely, the planting a tree over the
head of the dead, and the spirit-connection which this tree
has with the dead. The robbery of the fruit brings back the
dead Sir Roger to protect it, and this must be his ghost or
spirit. In popular superstition this incident is not uncommon.
Thus Aubrey in his <i>Remains of Gentilisme</i>, notes that &#8220;in the
parish of Ockley some graves have rose trees planted at the
head and feet,&#8221; and then proceeds to say, &#8220;They planted a tree
or a flower on the grave of their friend, and they thought the
soule of the party deceased went into the tree or plant&#8221; (p. 155).
In Scotland a branch falling from an oak, the Edgewell tree,
standing near Dalhousie Castle, portended mortality to the
family (Dalyell, <i>Darker Superstitions</i>, p. 504). Compare with
this a similar superstition noted in Carew&#8217;s <i>History of Cornwall</i>,
p. 325, and Mr. Keary&#8217;s treatment of this cult in his
<i>Outlines of Primitive Belief</i>, pp. 66-67. In folk-tales this
incident also appears; the spirit of the dead enters the tree
and resents robbery of its fruit, possession of which gives
power over the soul or spirit of the dead.</p>

<p>The game is, therefore, not merely the acting of a funeral,
but more particularly shows the belief that a dead person is
cognisant of actions done by the living, and capable of resenting
personal wrongs and desecration of the grave. It
shows clearly the sacredness of the grave; but what, perhaps
to us, is the most interesting feature, is the way in which the
game is played. This clearly shows a survival of the method
of portraying old plays. The ring of children act the part of
&#8220;chorus,&#8221; and relate the incidents of the play. The three
actors say nothing, only act their several parts in dumb show.
The raising and lowering of the arms on the part of the child
who plays &#8220;apple tree,&#8221; the quiet of &#8220;Old Roger&#8221; until he
has to jump up, certainly show the early method of actors
when details were presented by action instead of words.
Children see no absurdity in being a &#8220;tree,&#8221; or a &#8220;wall,&#8221;
&#8220;apple,&#8221; or animal. They simply <i>are</i> these things if the game
demands it, and they think nothing of incongruities.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, suggest that children have preserved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_24" id="PageII_24">[24]</a></span>
this game an old play, but I consider that in this and similar
games they have preserved methods of acting and detail (now
styled traditional), as given in an early or childish period of the
drama, as for example in the mumming plays. Traditional
methods of acting are discussed by Mr. Ordish, <i>Folk-lore</i>, ii. 334.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_7" id="GameII_7"></a>Old Soldier</h3>

<p>One player personates an old soldier, and begs of all the
other players in turn for left-off garments, or anything else he
chooses. The formula still used at Barnes by children is,
&#8220;Here comes an old soldier from the wars [or from town],
pray what can you give him?&#8221; Another version is<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here comes an old soldier from Botany Bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you got anything to give him to-day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&#8212;Liverpool (C. C. Bell).</p>

<p>The questioned child replying must be careful to avoid using
the words, Yes! No! Nay! and Black, White, or Grey. These
words are tabooed, and a forfeit is exacted every time one or
other is used. The old soldier walks lame, and carries a stick.
He is allowed to ask as many questions, talk as much as he
pleases, and to account for his destitute condition.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Some years ago when colours were more limited in
number, it was difficult to promise garments for a man&#8217;s wear
which were neither of these colours tabooed. Miss Burne
(<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 526), in describing this game says,
&#8220;The words Red or Blue are sometimes forbidden, as well as
Yes or No,&#8221; and adds that &#8220;This favourite old game gives
scope for great ingenuity on the part of the beggar, and &#8216;it
seems not improbable&#8217; (to use a time-honoured antiquarian
phrase!) that the expression &#8216;To come the old soldier over a
person&#8217; may allude to it.&#8221; Halliwell (<i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, p. 224)
describes the game as above.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children form a ring and move round, singing the
first two lines. Then they curtsey, or &#8220;douk down,&#8221; all
together; the one who is last has to tell her sweetheart&#8217;s
name. The other lines are then sung and the game is continued.
The children&#8217;s names are mentioned as each one
names his or her sweetheart.</p>

<p>This is apparently the game of which &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_6">All the Boys</a>,&#8221;

<h3><a name="GameII_9" id="GameII_9"></a>One Catch-all</h3>

<p>The words &#8220;Cowardy, cowardy custard&#8221; are repeated by
children playing at this game when they advance towards the
one who is selected to catch them, and dare or provoke her
to capture them. Ray, <i>Localisms</i>, gives Costard, the head;
a kind of opprobrious word used by way of contempt. Bailey
gives Costead-head, a blockhead; thus elucidating this exclamation
which may be interpreted, &#8220;You cowardly blockhead,
catch me if you dare&#8221; (Baker&#8217;s <i>Northamptonshire
Glossary</i>).</p>

<p>The words used were, as far as I remember,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cowardy, cowardy custard, eat your father&#8217;s mustard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catch me if you can.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To compel a person to &#8220;eat&#8221; something disagreeable is a
well-known form of expressing contempt. The rhyme was
supposed to be very efficacious in rousing an indifferent or
lazy player when playing &#8220;<a href="#GameII_224">touch</a>&#8221; (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is generally played as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Two of the taller children stand facing each other, holding
up their clasped hands. One is named Orange and the other
Lemon. The other players, grasping one another&#8217;s dresses,
run underneath the raised arms and round Orange, and then
under the arms again and round Lemon, while singing the
verses. The three concluding lines are sung by &#8220;Orange&#8221; and
&#8220;Lemon&#8221; in a slow emphatic manner, and at the word &#8220;head&#8221;
they drop their arms over one of the children passing between
them, and ask her secretly whether she will be <i>orange</i> or
<i>lemon</i>. The captive chooses her side, and stands behind
whichever leader she selects, placing her arms round her waist.
The game continues till every one engaged in it has ranged
herself behind one or other of the chiefs. When the two
parties are ranged a &#8220;tug of war&#8221; takes place until one of
the parties breaks down, or is pulled over a given mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_33" id="PageII_33">[33]</a></span>In the <a href="#OrangesMiddlesex">Middlesex version</a> (Miss Winfield) the children form
a ring and go round singing the verses, and apparently there
is neither catching the &#8220;last man&#8221; nor the &#8220;tug.&#8221; Mr.
Emslie says he has seen and played the game in Middlesex,
and it always terminated with the cutting off the last man&#8217;s
head. In the <a href="#OrangesSymondsbury">Symondsbury version</a> the players drop their
hands when they say &#8220;Sunday.&#8221; No tug is mentioned in
the <a href="#OrangesEHeaton1">first Earls Heaton version</a> of the game (Mr. Hardy). In
the <a href="#OrangesEHeaton2">second version</a> he says bells are represented by children.
They should have in their hands, bells, or some article to represent
them. All stand in a row. First, second, and third bells
stand out in turn to sing. All rush for bells to sing chorus.
Miss Barclay writes: The children of the Fernham and Longcot
choir, playing on Christmas Eve, 1891, pulled across a
handkerchief. In Monton, Lancashire, Miss Dendy says the
game is played as elsewhere, but without words. In a Swaffham
version (Miss Matthews), the girls sometimes call themselves
&#8220;Plum pudding and roast beef,&#8221; or whatever fancy may suggest,
instead of oranges and lemons. They join hands high
enough for the others to pass under, which they do to a call
of &#8220;Ducky, Ducky,&#8221; presently the hands come down and catch
one, who is asked in <i>confidence</i> which she likes best. The game
then proceeds in the usual way, one side trying to pull the
other over a marked line. Oranges and lemons at Bocking,
Essex, is an abbreviated variant of the rhyme printed by
Halliwell (<i>Folk-lore Record</i>, iii., part II., 171). In Nottinghamshire,
Miss Peacock says it is sometimes called &#8220;Tarts and
Cheesecakes.&#8221; Moor (<i>Suffolk Words</i>) mentions &#8220;Oranges and
Lemons&#8221; as played by both girls and boys, and adds, &#8220;I
believe it is nearly the same as &#8216;<a href="#GameII_47">Plum Pudding and Roast
Beef</a>.&#8217;&#8221; In the <a href="#OrangesSuffolk">Suffolk version</a> sent by Mrs. Haddon a new
word is introduced, &#8220;carwoo.&#8221; This is the signal for one of the

<p>Mr. Halliwell (<i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, No. cclxxxi.) adopts the
verses entitled, &#8220;The Merry Bells of London,&#8221; from Gammer<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_34" id="PageII_34">[34]</a></span>
Gurton&#8217;s <i>Garland</i>, 1783, as the origin of this game. In Aberdeen,
Mr. M. L. Rouse tells me he has heard Scotch children
apparently playing the same game, &#8220;Oranges and Lemons, ask,
Which would you have, &#8216;A sack of corn or a sack of coals?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This game indicates a contest between two opposing
parties, and a punishment, and although in the game the
sequence of events is not at all clear, the contest taking place
after the supposed execution, these two events stand out very
clearly as the chief factors. In the endeavour to ascertain who
the contending parties were, one cannot but be struck with the
significance of the bells having different saint&#8217;s names. Now
the only places where it would be probable for bells to be
associated with more than one saint&#8217;s name within the circuit
of a small area are the old parish units of cities and boroughs.
Bells were rung on occasions when it was necessary or
advisable to call the people together. At the ringing of the
&#8220;alarm bell&#8221; the market places were quickly filled by crowds
of citizens; and by turning to the customs of these places in
England, it will be found that contest games between parishes,
and between the wards of parishes, were very frequent (see
Gomme&#8217;s <i>Village Community</i>, pp. 241-243). These contests
were generally conducted by the aid of the football, and in
one or two cases, such as at Ludlow, the contest was with
a rope, and, in the case of Derby, it is specially stated that
the victors were announced by the joyful ringing of their parish
bells. Indeed, Halliwell has preserved the &#8220;song on the bells
of Derby on football morning&#8221; (No. clxix.) as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pancake and fritters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say All Saints and St. Peter&#8217;s;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When will the <i>ball</i> come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say the bells of St. Alkmun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At two they will throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says Saint Werabo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! very well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says little Michel.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This custom is quite sufficient to have originated the game,
and the parallel which it supplies is evidence of the connection
between the two. Oranges and lemons were, in all probability,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_35" id="PageII_35">[35]</a></span>
originally intended to mean the <i>colours</i> of the two contesting
parties, and not <i>fruits</i> of those names. In contests between
the people of a town and the authority of baron or earl,
the adherents of each side ranged themselves under and
wore the colours of their chiefs, as is now done by political
partizans.</p>

<p>The rhymes are probably corrupted, but whether from some
early cries or calls of the different parishes, or from sentences
which the bells were supposed to have said or sung when
tolled, it is impossible to say. The &#8220;clemming&#8221; of the bells
in the <a href="#OrangesSporle">Norfolk version</a> (No. 5) may have originated &#8220;St.
Clements,&#8221; and the other saints have been added at different
times. On the other hand, the general similarity of the rhymes
indicates the influence of some particular place, and, judging
by the parish names, London seems to be that place. If this
is so, the main incident of the rhymes may perhaps be due
to the too frequent distribution of a traitor&#8217;s head and limbs
among different towns who had taken up his cause. The exhibitions
of this nature at London were more frequent than
at any other place. The procession of a criminal to execution
was generally accompanied by the tolling of bells, and by
torches. It is not unlikely that the monotonous chant of
the last lines, &#8220;Here comes a light to light you to bed,&#8221; &amp;c.,
indicates this.<span class="addmark"><a href="#Add_1">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

tied at the ends, and on which a ring is strung. They pass

<p>The players provide themselves with short, stout sticks, and
a peg (a piece of wood sharpened at one or both ends). A
ring is made, and the peg is placed on the ground so as to
balance. One boy then strikes it with his stick to make it
spring or bounce up into the air; while in the air he strikes it
with his stick, and sends it as far as he possibly can. His
opponent declares the number of leaps in which the striker is
to cover the distance the peg has gone. If successful, he counts
the number of leaps to his score. If he fails, his opponent
leaps, and, if successful, the number of leaps count to his
score. He strikes the next time, and the same process is gone
through.&#8212;Earls Heaton, Yorks. (Herbert Hardy).</p>

<p>A game of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_25">Peg-top</a>.&#8221; The object of this game is to spin
the top within a certain circle marked out, in which the top is to
exhaust itself without once overstepping the bounds prescribed
(Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dict. Provincialisms</i>). Holloway (<i>Dictionary</i>) says,
&#8220;When boys play at &#8216;<a href="#GameII_25">Peg-top</a>,&#8217; a ring is formed on the ground,
within which each boy is to spin his top. If the top, when it
has ceased spinning, does not roll without the circle, it must
remain in the ring to be pegged at by the other boys, or he
redeems it by putting in an inferior one, which is called a
&#8216;Mull.&#8217; When the top does not roll out, it is said to be
&#8216;mulled.&#8217;&#8221; Mr. Emslie writes: &#8220;When the top fell within
the ring the boys cried, &#8216;One a penny!&#8217; When two had fallen
within the ring it was, &#8216;Two a penny!&#8217; When three, &#8216;Three
a penny, good as any!&#8217; The aim of each spinner was to do
what was called &#8216;drawing,&#8217; <i>i.e.</i>, bring his top down into the
ring, and at the same time draw the string so as to make the
top spin within the ring, and yet come towards the player and
out of the ring so as to fall without.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_25" id="GameII_25"></a>Peg-top</h3>

<p>One of the players, chosen by lot, spins his top. The other
players endeavour to strike this top with the pegs of their own
tops as they fling them down to spin. If any one fails to spin
his top in due form, he has to lay his top on the ground for
the others to strike at when spinning. The object of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_39" id="PageII_39">[39]</a></span>
spinner is to split the top which is being aimed at, so as to
release the peg, and the boy whose top has succeeded in
splitting the other top obtains the peg as his trophy of victory.
It is a matter of ambition to obtain as many pegs in this
manner as possible.&#8212;London (G. L. Gomme).</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_30" id="GameII_30"></a>Ph&#339;be</h3>

<p>The name of a dance mentioned in an old nursery rhyme.
A correspondent gave Halliwell the following lines of a very
old song, the only ones he recollected:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<h3><a name="GameII_32" id="GameII_32"></a>Pi-cow</h3>

<p>A game in which one half of the players are supposed to
keep a castle, while the others go out as a foraging or marauding
party. When the latter are all gone out, one of them
cries <i>Pee-ku</i>, which is a signal to those within to be on the
alert. Then those who are without attempt to get in. If
any one of them gets in without being seized by the holders
of the castle, he cries to his companions, <i>The hole&#8217;s won</i>; and
those who are within must yield the fortress. If one of the
assailants be taken before getting in he is obliged to change
sides and to guard the castle. Sometimes the guards are
successful in making prisoners of all the assailants. Also the
name given to the game of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_284">Hide and Seek</a>.&#8212;Jamieson.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_35" id="GameII_35"></a>Pillie-Winkie</h3>

<p>A sport among children in Fife. An egg, an unfledged
bird, or a whole nest is placed on a convenient spot. He who
has what is called the first <i>pill</i>, retires a few paces, and being
provided with a cowt or rung, is blindfolded, or gives his
promise to wink hard (whence he is called <i>Winkie</i>), and
moves forward in the direction of the object, as he supposes,
striking the ground with the stick all the way. He must
not shuffle the stick along the ground, but always strike
perpendicularly. If he touches the nest without destroying
it, or the egg without breaking it, he loses his vice or turn.
The same mode is observed by those who succeed him. When
one of the party breaks an egg he is entitled to all the rest
as his property, or to some other reward that has been
previously agreed on. Every art is employed, without removing
the nest or egg, to mislead the blindfolded player, who
is also called the Pinkie.&#8212;Jamieson. See &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_60">Blind Man&#8217;s Stan</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>A child&#8217;s peep-show. The charge for a peep is a pin, and,
under extraordinary circumstances of novelty, two pins.</p>

<p>I remember well being shown how to make a peep or poppet-show.
It was made by arranging combinations of colours from
flowers under a piece of glass, and then framing it with paper
in such a way that a cover was left over the front, which
could be raised when any one paid a pin to peep. The following
words were said, or rather sung, in a sing-song manner:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Pansies or other flowers are pressed beneath a piece of glass,
which is laid upon a piece of paper, a hole or opening, which
can be shut at pleasure, being cut in the paper. The charge
for looking at the show is a pin. The children say, &#8220;A pin
to look at a pippy-show.&#8221; They also say<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

common, being merely the throwing up of halfpence, the result
depending on a guess of heads or tails.&#8212;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_42" id="GameII_42"></a>Pitch and Toss</h3>

<p>This game was played by two or more players with &#8220;pitchers&#8221;&#8212;the
stakes being buttons. The ordinary bone button, or
&#8220;scroggy,&#8221; being the unit of value. The &#8220;pitcher&#8221; was made
of lead, circular in form, from one and a half inch to two
inches in diameter, and about a quarter of an inch thick, with
an &#8220;<span class="lettsymb">H</span>&#8221; to stand for &#8220;Heads&#8221; cut on one side, and a &#8220;<span class="lettsymb">T</span>&#8221; for
&#8220;Tails&#8221; on the other side. An old-fashioned penny was sometimes
used, and an old &#8220;two-penny&#8221; piece I have by me bears
the marks of much service in the same cause. A mark having
been set up&#8212;generally a stone&#8212;and the order of play having
been fixed, the first player, A, threw his &#8220;pitcher&#8221; to the mark,
from a point six or seven yards distant. If he thought he lay
sufficiently near the mark to make it probable that he would be
the nearest after the others had thrown, he said he would &#8220;lie.&#8221;
The effect of that was that the players who followed had to lie
also, whatever the character of their throw. If A&#8217;s throw was
a poor one he took up his &#8220;pitcher.&#8221; B then threw, if he
threw well he &#8220;lay,&#8221; if not he took up his pitcher, in hope of
making a better throw, as A had done. C then played in the
same manner. D followed and &#8220;lay.&#8221; E played his pitcher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_44" id="PageII_44">[44]</a></span>
and had no choice but to lie. F followed in the same way.
These being all the players, A threw again, and though his
second might have been worse than his first, he has to lie like
the others. B and C followed. All the pitchers have been
thrown, and are lying round the mark, in the following order
of proximity&#8212;for that regulates the subsequent play&#8212;B&#8217;s is
nearest, then D&#8217;s follows, in order by A, C, F, E. B takes the
pitchers, and piles them up one above the other, and tosses
them into the air. Three (let us say) fall head up, D&#8217;s, A&#8217;s,
and F&#8217;s. These three B keeps in his hand. D, who was next
nearest the mark, takes the three remaining pitchers, and in
the same manner tosses them into the air. B&#8217;s and C&#8217;s fall
head up, and are retained by D. A, who comes third, takes
the remaining pitcher, E&#8217;s, and throws it up. If it falls a
head he keeps it, and the game is finished except the reckoning;
if it falls a tail it passes on to the next player, C, who
throws it up. If it falls a head he keeps it, if a tail, it is passed
on to F, and from him to E, and on to B, till it turns up a head.
Let us suppose that happens when F throws it up. The game
is now finished, and the reckoning takes place<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, D, A, and F should each pay a button to
B. B and C should each pay one to D. E should pay one to
F. But in practice it was simpler, F holding one pitcher had,
in the language of the game, &#8220;freed himself.&#8221; D had &#8220;freed
himself,&#8221; and was in addition one to the good. B had &#8220;freed
himself,&#8221; and was two to the good. A, C, and E, not having
&#8220;freed themselves,&#8221; were liable for the one D had won and the
two B had won, and settled with D and B, without regard to
the actual hand that held the respective pitchers. It simplified
the reckoning, though theoretically the reckoning should
have followed the more roundabout method. Afterwards the
game was begun <i>de novo</i>. E, who was last, having first pitch&#8212;the
advantage of that place being meant to compensate him<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_45" id="PageII_45">[45]</a></span>
in a measure for his ill luck in the former game. The stakes
were the plain horn or bone buttons&#8212;buttons with nicks were
more valuable&#8212;a plain one being valued at two &#8220;scroggies,&#8221;
or &#8220;scrogs,&#8221; the fancy ones, and especially livery buttons,
commanding a higher price.&#8212;Rev. W. Gregor. See &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_94">Buttons</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_44" id="GameII_44"></a>Pits</h3>

<p>A game at marbles. The favourite recreation with the
young fishermen in West Cornwall. Forty years ago &#8220;Pits&#8221;
and &#8220;Towns&#8221; were the common games, but the latter only is
now played. Boys who hit their nails are looked on with
great contempt, and are said &#8220;to fire Kibby.&#8221; When two are
partners, and one in playing accidentally hits the other&#8217;s
marble, he cries out, &#8220;No custance,&#8221; meaning that he has
a right to put back the marble struck; should he fail to do
so, he would be considered &#8220;out.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 60.
There is no description of the method of playing. It may be
the same as &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_119">Cherry Pits</a>,&#8221; played with marbles instead of
cherry stones (vol. i. p. 66). Mr. Newell, <i>Games and Songs
of American Children</i>, p. 187, says &#8220;The pits are thrown over
the palm; they must fall so far apart that the fingers can be
passed between them. Then with a fillip of the thumb the
player makes his pit strike the enemy&#8217;s and wins both.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_45" id="GameII_45"></a>Pize Ball</h3>

<p>Sides are picked; as, for example, six on one side and six on
the other, and three or four marks or tuts are fixed in a
field. Six go out to field, as in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_163">cricket</a>, and one of these
throws the ball to one of those who remain &#8220;at home,&#8221; and
the one &#8220;at home&#8221; strikes or pizes it with his hand. After
pizing it he runs to one of the &#8220;tuts,&#8221; but if before he can
get to the &#8220;tut&#8221; he is struck with the ball by one of those
in the field, he is said to be <i>burnt</i>, or out. In that case the
other side go out to field.&#8212;Addy&#8217;s <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>A game at marbles of two or more boys. Each puts an equal
number of marbles in a row close together, a mark is made at
some little distance called taw; the distance is varied according
to the number of marbles in a row. The first boy tosses
at the row in such a way as to pitch just on the marbles, and
so strike as many as he can out of the line; all that he strikes
out he takes; the rest are put close together again, and two
other players take their turn in the same manner, till all the
marbles are struck out of the line, when they all stake afresh
and the game begins again.&#8212;Baker&#8217;s <i>Northamptonshire

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_61" id="PageII_61">[61]</a></span>(<i>b</i>) A ring is formed by the children joining hands. One
child kneels in the centre, covering her face with her hands.
The ring dances round, and sings the first two verses. The
kneeling child then takes her hands from her face and sings
the next verse, still kneeling. While the ring sings the next
verse, she rises and chooses one child out of the ring. They
stand together, holding hands while the others sing the marriage
formula, and kiss each other at the command. The ring of
children dance round quickly while singing this. When finished
the first &#8220;Mary&#8221; takes a place in the ring, and the other child
kneels down (Barnes and other places). At <a href="#PoorMaryEnborne">Enborne</a> school,
Newbury (Miss Kimber), this game is played by boys and girls.
All the children in the ring sing the first two verses. Then
the boys alone in the ring sing the next verse; all the ring
singing the fourth. While singing this the kneeling child rises
and holds out her hand to any boy she prefers, who goes into
the ring with her. When he is left in the ring at the commencement
of the game again, a boy&#8217;s name is substituted for
that of &#8220;Mary.&#8221; There appears to be no kissing. In the
<a href="#PoorMaryLiphook">Liphook version</a> (Miss Fowler), after the girl has chosen her
sweetheart the ring breaks, and the two walk out and then
kneel down, returning to the ring and kissing each other. A
version identical with that of <a href="#PoorMaryBarnes">Barnes</a> is played by the girls of
Clapham High School. All tunes sent me were similar to
<a href="#TunePoorMary">that given</a>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The analysis of the game rhymes is on <a href="#PageII_56">pp. 56-60</a>.</p>

<p>This analysis shows that the incidents expressed by the
rhymes are practically the same in all the versions. In the
majority of the cases the weeping is depicted as part of a ceremony,
by which it is known that a girl desires a lover; she is
enabled then to choose one, and to be married. The marriage
formula is the usual one in the <a href="#PoorMaryBarnes">Barnes&#8217; version</a>, but follows
another set of words in three other versions. In the cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_62" id="PageII_62">[62]</a></span>
where the marriage is neither expressed by a formula, nor
implied by other means (<a href="#PoorMaryWinterton">Winterton</a> and <a href="#PoorMaryDean">Forest of Dean</a>), the
versions are evidently fragments only, and probably at one
time ended, as in the other cases, with marriage. But in
three other cases the ending is not with marriage. The <a href="#PoorMaryEHeaton">Earls
Heaton</a> and <a href="#PoorMaryGregor">Scottish versions</a> represent the cause of weeping
as the death of a father, the Berkshire version introduces the
apparently unmeaning incident of Mary bearing a shepherd&#8217;s
cross, and the <a href="#PoorMarySDevon">South Devon version</a> represents the cause of
weeping the death of a lover at sea. It is obvious that at places
where sailors abound, the incident of weeping for a sailor-lover
who is dead would get inserted, and the fact of this change
only occurring once in the versions I have collected, tells all the
more strongly in favour of the original version having represented
marriage and love, and not death, but it does not follow
that the marriage formula belongs to the oldest or original
form of the game. I am inclined to think this has been added
since marriage was thought to be the natural and proper result
of choosing a sweetheart.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The change in some of the verses, as in the <a href="#PoorMaryCambridge">Cambridge
version</a>, is due to corruption and the marked decadence now
occurring in these games. No. 13 in the analysis is from the
game &#8220;<a href="#GameII_59">Pretty little girl of mine</a>,&#8221; and Nos. 42-3 &#8220;<a href="#GameII_93">Ring o&#8217; Roses</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One child is chosen to act the part of the widow. The
players join hands and form a circle. The widow takes her
stand in the centre of the circle in a posture indicating sorrow.
The girls in the circle trip round and round, and sing the first
five lines. The widow then chooses one of the ring. The ring
then sings the marriage formula, the two kiss each other, and
the game is continued, the one chosen to be the mate of the
first widow becoming the widow in turn (Nairn).</p>

<p>This is a boys&#8217; game. Any number may join in it. The
players join hands and stand in line. The leader, generally
a bigger boy, begins to bend round, at first slowly, then with
more speed, drawing the whole line after him. The circular
motion is communicated to the whole line, and, unless the boys
at the end farthest from the leader run very quickly, the
momentum throws them off their feet with a dash if they do
not drop their hold.&#8212;Keith, Nairn (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <a href="#PrayFochabers">Scottish version</a> of this game is played as follows:&#8212;All
the players stand in a line except two, who stand facing
them. These two join hands crosswise, and then advancing
and retiring, sing to the child at the end of the line the first
four lines. The first child refuses, and they then dance round,
singing the second verse. They sing the first verse again,
and on her compliance she joins the two, and all three dance
round together, singing the last verse. The three then advance
and retire, singing the first verse to another child.</p>

<p>The <a href="#PrayCornwall">Cornish version</a> is played differently: a ring is formed,
boy and girl standing alternately in the centre. The child in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_67" id="PageII_67">[67]</a></span>
the middle holds a white handkerchief by two of its corners;
if a boy he would single out one of the girls, dance backwards
and forwards opposite to her, and sing the first verse. If
the answer were &#8220;No!&#8221; spoken with averted head over the
left shoulder, he sang the second verse. Occasionally three
or four in turn refused. When the request was granted the
words were changed to the fourth verse. The handkerchief
was then carefully spread on the floor; the couple knelt on
it and kissed: the child formerly in the middle joined the
ring, and the other took his place, or if he preferred it remained
in the centre; in that case the children clasped hands
and sang together the first verse over again, the last to enter
the ring having the privilege of selecting the next partner.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Miss Courtney says (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 47), that this
game is quite a thing of the past. Of the <a href="#PrayHurst">Hurstmonceux
version</a>, Miss Chase says, &#8220;This game is not fully remembered.
It was played about 1850.&#8221; The words indicate an invitation
to the dance similar to those in &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_177">Cushion Dance</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_250">Green

<p class="source">&#8212;Galloway, N.B. (J. G. Carter).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is played in the same way in all the different
variants I have given, except a slight addition in the <a href="#PrettySuffolk">Suffolk</a>
(Mrs. Haddon). A ring is formed by the children joining
hands&#8212;one child stands in the centre. The ring dances or
moves slowly round, singing the verses. The child in the
centre kneels down when the words are sung, rises and
chooses a partner from the ring, kisses her when so commanded,
and then takes a place in the ring, leaving the other
child in the centre. In those cases where the marriage formula
is not given, the kissing would probably be omitted.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Of the twenty-four versions given there are not two
alike, and this game is distinguished from all others by the
singular diversity of its variants; although the original structure
of the verses has been preserved to some extent, they
seem to have been the sport of the inventive faculty of each
different set of players. Lines have been added, left out, and
altered in every direction, and in the example from <a href="#PrettyHazelbury">Hazelbury
Bryan</a>, in Dorsetshire (No. xxiii.), a portion of an old song or
ballad has been added to the game rhyme. These alterations
occur not only in different counties, but in the same counties,
as may be seen by the <a href="#PrettySymondsbury">Dorset</a>, <a href="#PrettyHampshire">Hants</a>, <a href="#PrettyEccleshall">Staffordshire</a>, and
<a href="#PrettyMaxey">Northants</a> examples. Mr. Carter says of the <a href="#PrettyGalloway">Galloway game</a>
that the kissing match sometimes degenerates into a spitting
match, according to the temper of the parties concerned. In
the <a href="#PrettySuffolk">Suffolk version</a> (Mrs. Haddon), at the words &#8220;Lean across
the water,&#8221; the two in the centre lean over the arms of those
forming the ring. These words and action are probably an
addition. They belong to the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_104">Rosy Apple, Lemon and
Pear</a>&#8221; game.</p>

<p>These peculiar characteristics of the game do not permit of
much investigation into the original words of the game-rhyme,
but they serve to illustrate, in a very forcible manner, the
exactly opposite characteristics of nearly all the other games,
which preserve, in almost stereotyped fashion, the words of the
rhymes. It appears most probable that the verses belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_77" id="PageII_77">[77]</a></span>
originally to some independent game like &#8220;<a href="#GameII_120">Sally, Sally Water</a>,&#8221;
and that, when divorced from their original context, they lent
themselves to the various changes which have been made. The
minute application of modern ideas is seen in the version from
<a href="#PrettyGambledown">Gambledown</a>, where &#8220;A bottle of wine and a guinea, too,&#8221;
becomes &#8220;A bottle of wine and a biscuit, too;&#8221; and at West
Haddon, in Northamptonshire, a variant of the marriage
formula is given in <i>Northants Notes and Queries</i>, ii. 106, as<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children place themselves in a row. They each
choose a colour to represent them. One player must be <i>pink</i>.
Another player stands facing them, and dances to and fro,
singing the first four lines. The dancer then sings the next
two lines, and Miss Pink having answered rushes forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_78" id="PageII_78">[78]</a></span>
catches hold of the dancer&#8217;s hand, and sings the next verse.
Each colour is then taken in turn, but Miss Pink must always
be first.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This is clearly a variant of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_58">Pray, Pretty Miss</a>,&#8221; colours

<p>Christmas morning is ushered in by the little maidens playing
at the game of &#8220;Prickey Sockey,&#8221; as they call it. They are
dressed up in their best, with their wrists adorned with rows
of pins, and run about from house to house inquiring who will
play at the game. The door is opened and one cries out<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Prickey sockey for a pin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I car not whether I loss or win.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The game is played by the one holding between her two
forefingers and thumbs a pin, which she clasps tightly to prevent
her antagonist seeing either part of it, while her opponent
guesses. The head of the pin is &#8220;sockey,&#8221; and the point is
&#8220;prickey,&#8221; and when the other guesses she touches the end
she guesses at, saying, &#8220;this for prickey,&#8221; or &#8220;this for sockey,&#8221;
At night the other delivers her two pins. Thus the game is
played, and when the clock strikes twelve it is declared up; that
is, no one can play after that time.&#8212;<i>Mirror</i>, 1828, vol. x. p. 443.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_66" id="GameII_66"></a>Priest of the Parish</h3>

<p>William Carleton describes this game as follows:&#8212;&#8220;One of
the boys gets a wig upon himself, goes out on the floor, places
the boys in a row, calls on his man Jack, and says to each,
&#8216;What will you be?&#8217; One answers, &#8216;I&#8217;ll be Black Cap,&#8217; another,
&#8216;Red Cap,&#8217; and so on. He then says, &#8216;The priest of the parish
has lost his considering-cap. Some says this, and some says
that, but I say my man Jack.&#8217; Man Jack then, to put it off
himself, says, &#8216;Is it me, sir?&#8217; &#8216;Yes you, sir.&#8217; &#8216;You lie, sir.&#8217;
&#8216;Who then, sir?&#8217; &#8216;Black Cap.&#8217; If Black Cap then doesn&#8217;t
say, &#8216;Is it me, sir?&#8217; before the priest has time to call him he
must put his hand on his ham and get a pelt of the brogue.

<p>Strutt (<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 78), says, &#8220;This game was
much practised in former times. The first mention of this
sport that I have met with occurs in the Proclamations at the
head of the Parliamentary proceedings, early in the reign of
Edward III., where it is spoken of as a childish amusement;
and prohibited to be played in the avenues of the palace at
Westminster during the Sessions of Parliament, because of
the interruption it occasioned to the members and others
in passing to and fro.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The performance of this pastime
requires two parties of equal number, each of them having a
base or home, as it is usually called to themselves, at the
distance of about twenty or thirty yards. The players then
on either side taking hold of hands extend themselves in length
and opposite to each other, as far as they conveniently can,
always remembering that one of them must touch the base;
when any one of them quits the hand of his fellow and runs
into the field, which is called giving the chase, he is immediately
followed by a second from the former side, and he
by a second opponent; and so on alternately, until as many
are out as choose to run, every one pursuing the man he first
followed and no other; and if he overtake him near enough to
touch him, his party claims one toward their game, and both
return home. Then they run forth again and again in like
manner, until the number is completed that decides the victory;
this number is optional. It is to be observed that every person
on either side who touches another during the chase, claims
one for his party.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strutt describes the game in Essex as follows:&#8212;&#8220;They play<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_81" id="PageII_81">[81]</a></span>
this game with the addition of two prisons, which are stakes
driven into the ground, parallel with the home boundaries,
and about thirty yards from them; and every person who is
touched on either side in the chase is sent to one or other of
these prisons, where he must remain till the conclusion of the
game, if not delivered previously by one of his associates, and
this can only be accomplished by touching him, which is a
difficult task, requiring the performance of the most skilful
players, because the prison belonging to either party is always
much nearer to the base of their opponents than to their own;
and if the person sent to relieve his confederate be touched
by an antagonist before he reaches him, he also becomes a
prisoner, and stands in equal need of deliverance.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Sports and
Pastimes</i>, p. 80.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo2096.png" alt="Prisoner's Base Playing Field" width="249" height="271" />
</div>

<p>But this is not quite the same as it is played in London.
There the school ground is divided in the following manner:&#8212;
The boys being divided into equal
sides, with a captain for each, one
party takes up its quarters in <span class="smcap">a</span>, the
other in <span class="smcap">b</span>. Lots are chosen as to
which side commences. Then one
member of the side so chosen (say <span class="smcap">b</span>)
starts off for the middle of the playground
and cries out &#8220;Chevy, Chevy
Chase, one, two, three;&#8221; thereupon
it becomes the object of the side <span class="smcap">b</span>
to touch him before reaching home
again. If unsuccessful one from side <span class="smcap">b</span> goes to the middle,
and so on until a prisoner is secured from one of the sides.
Then the struggle commences in earnest, after the fashion
described by Strutt as above. If a boy succeeds in getting
to the prison of his side without being touched by an opponent,
he releases a prisoner, and brings him back home again to help
in the struggle. The object of the respective sides is to place
all their opponents in prison, and when that is accomplished
they rush over to the empty home and take possession of it.
The game then begins again from opposite sides, the winning
side counting one towards the victory.&#8212;London (G. L. Gomme).</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_82" id="PageII_82">[82]</a></p>

<p>This was once a favourite game among young men in North
Shropshire (and Cheshire). It was played yearly at Norton-in-Hales
Wakes, and the winning party were decorated with
ribbons. Men-servants, in the last century, were wont to ask
a day&#8217;s holiday to join or witness a game of &#8220;Prison-bars,&#8221;
arranged beforehand as a cricket-match might be (see <i>Byegones</i>,
2nd May 1883). A form of the game still survives there
among the school-children, under the name of &#8220;Prison Birds.&#8221;
The Birds arrange themselves in pairs behind each other,
facing a large stone or stump placed at some little distance.
Before them, also facing the stone, stands one player, called
the Keeper. When he calls, &#8220;Last pair out!&#8221; the couple next
behind him run to the stone and touch hands over it. If they
can do so without being touched by the Keeper, they are free,
and return to a position behind the other birds; but any one
whom he touches must remain behind the stone &#8220;in prison.&#8221;&#8212;Ellesmere
(Burne&#8217;s <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 524).</p>

<p>The Ellesmere inhabitants were formerly accustomed to
devote their holiday occasions to the game, and in the year
1764 the poet laureate of the town (Mr. David Studley) composed
some lines on the game as it was played by the Married
<i>v.</i> Single at Ellesmere. They are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The moor referred to in the last line of the second verse was

the author, became so exasperated, that, to appease him, the
words &#8220;the game is our&#8217;n&#8221; were substituted for the words

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <a href="#PunchFochabers1">Fochabers&#8217; game</a> is played by girls only. The
players join hands and form a ring. They dance briskly
round, singing the verse. The last word, &#8220;me,&#8221; is pronounced
with strong emphasis, and all the girls jump, and if one falls
she has to leave the ring. The game is carried on until all
the players fall. In the <a href="#PunchBelfast">Belfast game</a>, at the words &#8220;one,
two, three,&#8221; the players drop down in a crouching position
for a few seconds. In the <a href="#PunchAnnaverna">Louth (Ireland) game</a> the players all
curtsey after the first line, and the one who rises last is the bride.
She is led outside the ring by another, and asked to whom she
is engaged. She tells without letting those in the ring hear,
and the two return to the ring saying the second line. Then
all the ring sing the next three lines, and then the girl who
has been told the name tells it to the ring, who thereupon
sing or say the remaining lines of the verse.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The <a href="#PunchAnnaverna">Louth version</a> has more detail in its movements,
and probably represents the oldest form. At all events, it
supplies the reason for the words and movements, which are
not quite so obvious in the other versions. Many ancient
monoliths are known as &#8220;Punch Bowls,&#8221; and it may be that
this game is the relic of an old marriage ceremony, &#8220;at the
stones.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The players stand in a circle, boy and girl alternately,
and sing the lines. At the fourth line they all clap their
hands, keeping time with the song. When singing the seventh
line each boy takes the girl on his left hand,&#8212;dances round
with her and places her on his right hand. This is done till<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_88" id="PageII_88">[88]</a></span>
each girl has been all round the circle, and has been turned or
danced with by each boy. In the <a href="#PushWolstanton">Wolstanton version</a> (Miss
Bush), after singing the first four lines, the children fall
behind one another, march round, clapping their hands and
singing; at the seventh line they all join in couples and gallop
round very quickly to the end. When they finish, the girls
stand at the side of the boys in couples, and change places
every time they go round until each girl has partnered each
boy. At Hexham there is rather more of the regular dance
about the game at the beginning. At the fourth line they set
to partners and swing round, the girls changing places at the
end, and continuing until they have been all round each time
with a different partner.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game seems of kin to the old-fashioned country
dances. Miss Bush writes that this game was introduced into
the school playground from Derbyshire a few years ago, and
is sung to a simple tune.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo2103.png" alt="Playing Puss in the Corner" width="401" height="200" />
</div>

<p>The children stand at fixed points: one stands in the middle
and chants, &#8220;Poor puss
wants a corner.&#8221; The
others beckon with the
fore-finger, and calling,
&#8220;Puss, puss,&#8221; run
from point to point.
Puss runs also to one
of the vacant spaces.
The one left out becomes puss.&#8212;Monton, Lancashire (Miss
Dendy).</p>

<p>The players place themselves each in some &#8220;coign of vantage,&#8221;
as the play place allows; one player in the middle is
&#8220;out.&#8221; Those in the corners change places with each other
at choice, calling, &#8220;Puss, puss, puss,&#8221; to attract each other&#8217;s
attention. The one who is out watches his opportunity to slip
into a vacant corner, and oblige some one else to be &#8220;out.&#8221;
A favourite game <i>in the streets</i> of Market Drayton.&#8212;Burne&#8217;s
<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 523.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_89" id="PageII_89">[89]</a></span>When we played this game, the child who was to be &#8220;Puss&#8221;
was invariably decided upon by a counting-out rhyme. He or
she being the last of the five players &#8220;not he.&#8221; The words we
used when wishful to change corners were, &#8220;Puss, puss, give me
a drop of milk.&#8221; The players in the corners beckoned with the
finger to an opposite player in another corner (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>The game in Scotland is called &#8220;Moosie in the Corner,&#8221;
and is played by boys or girls, or by both together, either
outside or in a room. Each player takes a corner, and one
stands in the middle. On a given signal, usually by calling
out the word &#8220;Change,&#8221; a rush is made from the corners.
The aim of the one standing in the middle is to reach a
vacant corner. If the game is played in a room, as many
chairs, or other seats, are placed as there are players, less
one. Each takes a seat, and one is left standing. On the
word &#8220;Change&#8221; being called out, each jumps from the seat
and makes for another. The one standing strives to get a
seat in the course of the change.&#8212;Nairn and Macduff (Rev.
W. Gregor).</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_77" id="GameII_77"></a>Pyramid</h3>

<p>A circle of about two feet in diameter is made on the ground,
in the centre of which a pyramid is formed by several marbles.
Nine are placed as the base, then six, then four, and then one
on the top. The keeper of the pyramid then desires the other
players to shoot. Each player gives the keeper one marble for
leave to shoot at the pyramid, and all that the players can
strike out of the circle belong to them.&#8212;London streets (A. B.

<p>Men and women stand alternately in a circle, and one man
begins by placing his left hand on his left knee, and saying,
&#8220;There was an old Quaker and he went so.&#8221; This is repeated
all round the circle; the first man then says the same thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_90" id="PageII_90">[90]</a></span>
again, but this time he places his <i>right</i> hand on his <i>right</i> knee.
Then he places his hand on the girl&#8217;s shoulder, then round her
neck, and on her far shoulder, then looks into her face, and,
lastly, kisses her.&#8212;Sharleston, Yorks (Miss Fowler).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Sides are chosen, and two lines are formed; the words
are said by each line alternately. One line, in which is the
Queen, standing still or sitting down, the other line advancing
and retiring while singing the words. The latter line gives
one of their number a ball or some other small object to hold
in the hand in such a manner that it cannot be perceived.
All the players on this side then assume the same position&#8212;either
all put their hands behind them or fold their arms, put
their hands under their armpits, or under their skirts or
pinafores. The object of the other side is to guess which
child in the line has the ball. The line which has the ball
commences the game by advancing singing or saying the first
three or four lines. Queen Anne answers, and then names one
of the girls on the opposite side whom she suspects to have
the ball, and if she be right in her guess the lines change
sides. If she be wrong, the line retires in triumph, the girl
who possesses the ball holding it up to show the Queen she
is wrong. The children all curtsey when leaving the Queen&#8217;s
presence. Another girl of the line then takes the ball and
the game continues till the right holder of the ball is named.
When the Queen tells the line of players to &#8220;turn,&#8221; they all
spin round, coming back to face the Queen, and then stand
still again. In the <a href="#QueenNKelsey">North Kelsey version</a> (Miss Peacock) there
is only one player on Queen Anne&#8217;s side, the rest form the line.
This is also the case with the <a href="#QueenCornwall">Cornish game</a>.</p>

<p>This game appears to be in such a state of decadence that
it is difficult to do more than suggest an origin. It may be
that &#8220;Queen Anne&#8221; represents an oracle, and the petition is
addressed to her to discover the stolen treasure; but more
probably the players represent disguised damsels, one of whom
is a bride whose identity has to be found out by her showing
or possessing some object which belongs to or has been given
previously by her suitor. The &#8220;guessing&#8221; or &#8220;naming&#8221; a
particular person runs through all the versions, and is undoubtedly
the clue to the game. If the <a href="#QueenBelfast">Belfast version</a> is
the nearest to the original of those at present existing, and
there is every probability that this is so, especially as <a href="#QueenChambers">Chambers&#8217;
version</a> is so similar, an early form of the game might be
restored, and from this its origin may be ascertained. Using
the first four lines of one of Halliwell&#8217;s versions, and what

<p>The inference being that the chosen maiden is still free until
the suitor can try again, and is fortunate enough to indicate the
right maiden.</p>

<p>If this conjectural restoration of the verses be accepted on
the evidence, it would suggest that this game originated from
one of the not uncommon customs practised at weddings or
betrothals&#8212;when the suitor has to discriminate between several
girls all dressed precisely alike and distinguish his bride by
some token. (See &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_365">King William</a>.&#8221;) This incident of actual
primitive custom also obtains in folk tales, thus showing its
strong hold upon popular tradition, and hence increasing the
probability that it would reappear in games. It must be remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_102" id="PageII_102">[102]</a></span>
that the giving of gloves was a significant fact in
betrothals.</p>

<p>This game is said by some to have its origin in the use
of the sedan chair. A version taken from a newspaper
cutting (unfortunately I had not recorded the name and date,
but think it was probably the <i>Leeds Mercury</i> some years ago)
gives the following rhyme. The writer does not say whether
he knows it as a game<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lady Lucan she sits in a sedan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fair as a lily, as white as a swan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pair of green gloves to doff and to don.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mistress desires you will read one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can&#8217;t read one without them all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I pray this hand decline the ball.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this version there is still the puzzle to solve, or riddle
to read.<span class="addmark"><a href="#Add_74">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

suit the action to the words of the line. In the <a href="#QueenMaryCullen">Cullen game</a>
the girls stand in a row with one in front, who sings the verses
and chooses another player from the line. The two then join
hands and go round and round, singing the remaining verses.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_82" id="GameII_82"></a>Queen of Sheba</h3>

<p>Two rows of people sit on chairs face to face on each side
of a door, leaving just sufficient space between the lines for a
player to pass. At the end of the rows furthest from the door
sits the &#8220;Queen of Sheba,&#8221; with a veil or shawl over her head.
A player, hitherto unacquainted with the game, is brought to
the door, shown the Queen, and told to go up between the
rows, after being blindfolded, to kiss her, taking care, meanwhile,
to avoid treading on the toes of the people on each
side the alley leading to the lady. While his mind is diverted
by these instructions, and by the process of blindfolding, the
Queen gives up her seat to &#8220;the King,&#8221; who has been lurking
in the background. He assumes the veil and receives the kiss,
to the amusement of every one but the uninitiated player.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_83" id="GameII_83"></a>Ragman</h3>

<p>An ancient game, at which persons drew by chance poetical
descriptions of their characters, the amusement consisting&#8212;as
at modern games of a similar kind&#8212;in the peculiar application
or misapplication of the verses so selected at hazard by
the drawers.&#8212;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>. Halliwell goes on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_105" id="PageII_105">[105]</a></span>
say that the meaning of this term was first developed by
Mr. Wright in his <i>Anecdota Literaria</i>, 1844, where he has
printed two collections of ancient verses used in the game of
&#8220;Ragman.&#8221; Mr. Wright conjectures that the stanzas were
written one after another on a roll of parchment; that to each
stanza a string was attached at the side, with a seal or piece of
metal or wood at the end; and that when used the parchment
was rolled up with all the strings and their seals hanging
together, so that the drawer had no reason for choosing one
more than another, but drew one of the strings by mere chance,
and which he opened to see on what stanza he had fallen. If
such were the form of the game, we can very easily imagine
why the name was applied to a charter with an unusual
number of seals attached to it, which, when rolled up, would
present exactly the same appearance. Mr. Wright is borne
out in his opinion by an English poem, termed &#8220;Ragmane
roelle,&#8221; printed from MS., Fairfax, 16:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Sides are chosen, and a line made across the playground.
One of the sides goes up and the other goes down, and throws
their bonnets on the ground. Then one side tries to get one of
the opposite side across the line and crown him, and one of
the opposite side tries to crown him back. If another boy
can catch this player before he gets near him, he is crowned
also. All the time the one side is trying to take the bonnets.&#8212;Old

<p>The players, except one, take their stand at one side, and
one stands at the other side in front of them. When all are
ready, the one in front calls out &#8220;Cock,&#8221; or &#8220;Caron,&#8221; when all
rush across to the other side, and he tries to catch one of them
in crossing. The one caught helps to catch the others as they
run back. Each time the players run from the one side to the
other the word &#8220;Cock,&#8221; or &#8220;Caron,&#8221; is called out, and the
change is continued till all are caught&#8212;each one as caught
becoming a catcher. In Tyrie the game is called &#8220;Dyke King&#8221;

<p>(<i>b</i>) A ring is formed by the children joining hands. They
all dance round, singing the lines. At the word &#8220;Hasher&#8221; or
&#8220;Atcha&#8221; they all raise their hands [still clasped] up and down,
and at &#8220;all fall down&#8221; they sit suddenly down on the ground.
In Lancashire (Morton) they pause and curtsey deeply. The
imitation of sneezing is common to all. Miss Peacock says, in
Nottinghamshire they say &#8220;Hashem! Hashem!&#8221; and shake
their heads. In the <a href="#RingSheffield">Sheffield version</a> the children sing the
first eight lines going round, and all fall down when the
eighth is sang. They then form a ring by holding hands, and
move round singing the next three lines, and then they all fall
either on their knees or flat on their faces.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Versions of this game, identical with the <a href="#RingWinterton">Winterton one</a>,
have been sent me by Miss Winfield, Nottingham; others, almost
identical with the second <a href="#RingSporle">Norfolk version</a>, from Monton, Lancashire
(Miss Dendy), North Staffs. Potteries, Norbury, Staffs.,
(Miss A. Keary), Earls Heaton, Yorks. (H. Hardy). Addy,
<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>, gives a version almost identical with the
last <a href="#RingSporle">Sporle version</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_111" id="PageII_111">[111]</a></span>Addy, <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>, compares the old stories about
rose-laughing in Grimm&#8217;s <i>Teut. Myth.</i> iii. 1101. &#8220;Gifted children
of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Treyja wept
gold. Probably in the first instance they were Pagan beings
of light, who spread their brightness in the sky over the earth&#8212;&#8216;rose
children,&#8217; &#8216;sun children.&#8217;&#8221; This seems to me to be a
very apposite explanation of the game, the rhymes of which
are fairly well preserved, though showing in some of the variants
that decay towards a practical interpretation which will
soon abolish all traces of the mythical origin of game-rhyme.
It may, however, simply be the making, or &#8220;ringing,&#8221; a ring
or circle of roses or other flowers and bowing to this. Mr.
Addy&#8217;s suggestion does not account for the imitation of sneezing,
evidently an important incident, which runs through all
versions. Sneezing has always been regarded as an important
or supernatural event in every-day life, and many superstitious
beliefs and practices are connected with it both in savage and
civilised life. Newell (<i>Games and Songs of American Children</i>,
p. 127) describes &#8220;Ring around the Rosie,&#8221; apparently this
game, but the imitation of sneezing has been lost.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A number of boys and girls stand round one in the
middle, who repeats the lines, counting the children until one
is counted out by the end of the verse. The child upon
whom (14) falls is then taken out and forced to select one
of the other sex. The middle child then proceeds to say the
three last lines. All the children clap hands during the saying
(or singing) of the last line. If the child taken by lot joins in
the clapping, the selected child is rejected, and, I believe, takes
the middle place. Otherwise, I think there is a salute.&#8212;Halliwell.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is recorded by no authority except Halliwell,
and no version has reached me, so that I suppose it is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_113" id="PageII_113">[113]</a></span>
obsolete. It is a very good example of the oldest kind of
game, choosing partners or lovers by the &#8220;lot,&#8221; and may be
a relic of the May-day festival, when the worship of Flora
was accompanied by rites of marriage not in accord with
later ideas.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_97" id="GameII_97"></a>Ring-taw</h3>

<p>A rough ring is made on the ground, and the players each
place in it an equal share in &#8220;stonies,&#8221; or alleys. They each
bowl to the ring with another marble from a distance. The
boy whose marble is nearest has the first chance to &#8220;taw;&#8221; if
he misses a shot the second boy, whose marble was next
nearest to the ring, follows, and if he misses, the next, and
so on. If one player knocks out a marble, he is entitled to
&#8220;taw&#8221; at the rest in the ring until he misses; and if a
sure &#8220;tawer&#8221; not one of the others may have the chance to
taw. Any one&#8217;s &#8220;taw&#8221; staying within the ring after being
tawn at the &#8220;shots,&#8221; is said to be &#8220;fat,&#8221; and the owner of
the &#8220;taw&#8221; must then replace any marbles he has knocked
out in the ring.&#8212;Earls Heaton, Yorks. (Herbert Hardy).
Halliwell (<i>Dictionary</i>) describes this game very much as
above, except that a fine is imposed on those who leave the
taw in the ring. Ross and Stead (<i>Holderness Glossary</i>)
give this game as follows:&#8212;&#8220;Two boys place an equal
number of marbles in the form of a circle, which are then
shot at alternately, each boy pocketing the marbles he hits.&#8221;
Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) says, &#8220;Ring-taw&#8221; is a marble
marked with a red ring used in the game of marbles. This
is commonly called &#8220;ring&#8221; for short. Evans (<i>Leicestershire
Glossary</i>) describes the game much the same as above, but
adds some further details of interest. &#8220;If the game be
knuckle-up the player stands and shoots in that position. If
the game be knuckle-down he must stoop and shoot with the
knuckle of the first finger touching the ground at taw. In
both cases, however, the player&#8217;s toe must be on taw. The
line was thus called taw as marking the place for the toe of
the player, and the marble a taw as being the one shot from
the taw-line, in contradistinction to those placed passively in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_114" id="PageII_114">[114]</a></span>
the ring-&#8216;line&#8217; in the one case, and &#8216;marble&#8217; in the other being
dropped as superfluous.&#8221;&#8212;Strutt (<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 384)
alludes to the game.</p>

<p>In Ireland this game is also called &#8220;<a href="#GameII_92">Ring</a>,&#8221; and is played
with marbles and buttons. A ring is marked out on a level
hard place, and every boy puts down a button. The buttons
are lightly struck in the centre of the ring, and all play their
marbles to the buttons. The nearest to them play first. The
line from which they play is generally about eight feet away,
and everybody does his best to strike the buttons. Any put
out are kept by the boy putting them out, and if a boy strikes
a button, or buttons, out, he can play on until he misses.&#8212;Waterville,
Cos. Kerry and Cork, T. J. Dennachy (through
Mrs. B. B. Green of Dublin).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo2130.png" alt="Roly-poly" width="280" height="185" />
</div>

<p>A game played with a certain number of pins and a ball,
resembling half a cricket ball. One pin is placed in the centre,
the rest (with the exception of one
called the Jack) are placed in a
circle round it; the Jack is placed
about a foot or so from the circle,
in a line with the one in the circle
and the one in the centre. The
centre one is called the King, the
one between that and the Jack, the Queen. The King counts
for three, the Queen two, and each of the other pins for one
each, except Jack. The art of the game lies in bowling down
all the pins except Jack, for if Jack is bowled down, the player
has just so many deducted from his former score as would
have been added if he had not struck the Jack (Holloway&#8217;s
<i>Dict. Provincialisms</i>). This game was formerly called &#8220;Half-bowl,&#8221;
and was prohibited by a statute of Edward IV. (Halliwell&#8217;s
<i>Dictionary</i>). Brockett (<i>North Country Words and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_116" id="PageII_116">[116]</a></span>
<i>Phrases</i>) says it is a game played at fairs and races. It is,
under the name of &#8220;Kayles,&#8221; well described and illustrated by
Strutt (<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 270, 271), which is reproduced
here. It will be seen that Jamieson describes it as played with
a pole or cudgel. He says this game no doubt gave origin to
the modern one of &#8220;Nine-pins;&#8221; though primitively the Kayle-pins
do not appear to have been confined to any certain
number nor shape.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Kayle-pins appear to have been
placed in one row only. He also says that &#8220;Half-bowl,&#8221;
played in Hertfordshire, was called &#8220;Roly-poly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jamieson (<i>Dictionary</i>) gives this as &#8220;Rollie-poly,&#8221; a game of
nine-pins, called also <i>Kayles</i>. The name &#8220;Rollie-poly&#8221; was
given to it because it was played with a pole, or cudgel, by
which the pins were knocked over. In the West of Scotland,
where this game was in great repute in olden times, it formed
one of the chief sports of Fastern&#8217;s-e&#8217;en, and was a favourite
amusement at fairs and races. The awards for successful
throwing were generally in the form of small cakes of gingerbread,
which were powerful incentives to the game, and never
failed to attract players in response to the cry, &#8220;Wha&#8217;ll try the
lucky Kayles?&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The players form a ring, one child stands in the centre,
who chooses a sweetheart from the ring when the fifth line
is sung; the two kiss, the first child takes her place in the
ring, the second child remains in the centre, and the game
begins again. This is the method adopted in most of the
versions. The <a href="#RosySymondsbury">Symondsbury game</a> is slightly different; the
first part is the same, but when the last line is sung the child
who was first in the middle must run away and take a place
in the ring as soon as she can. The second one remains in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_121" id="PageII_121">[121]</a></span>
the centre. The <a href="#RosyMaxey">Maxey (Northants.) version</a> is altogether different.
All the children but one stand in a row. The one
stands in front of them and sings the lines by herself; at
the last line she selects one from the line by naming her.
These two then sing the lines, &#8220;swinging round,&#8221; so described
by Mr. Sweeting&#8217;s informant. They then select a third when
singing the last line, and the three then swing round. This
is repeated till all the children from the line come into the
ring.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#RosyBerwickshire">Scotch versions</a> the players all stand in a line, with
one in front, and sing. At the end of the fourth line the one
in front chooses one from the line, and all again sing, mentioning
the name of the one chosen (Fraserburgh). At <a href="#RosyCullen">Cullen</a>,
one child stands out of the line and goes backwards and
forwards singing, then chooses her partner, and the two go
round the line singing.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A version which I collected in Barnes is not so perfect
as those given here, only the four first lines being sung. A
Kentish version sent me by Miss Broadwood is almost identical
with the <a href="#RosyDeptford">Deptford game</a>. Miss Broadwood&#8217;s version
commences<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>An Ipswich version is almost identical with that of <a href="#RosyHersham">Hersham</a>,
Surrey (Lady C. Gurdon&#8217;s <i>Suffolk County Folk-lore</i>, p. 64),
except that it begins &#8220;Golden apple&#8221; and ends with the
marriage formula<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<span class="i2">And now&#8217;s the time to kiss away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(<i>e</i>) This game is probably derived from the mode of dressing
the bride in the marriage ceremony, and is not very ancient.
The line &#8220;Lead her to the altar&#8221; probably indicates the earliest
version, corrupted later into &#8220;Lead her across the water,&#8221; and
this would prove a comparatively modern origin. If, however,
the &#8220;altar&#8221; version is a corruption of the &#8220;water&#8221; version, the
game may go back to the pre-Christian marriage ceremony, but
of this there is little evidence.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_105" id="GameII_105"></a>Roundabout, or Cheshire Round</h3>

<p>This is danced by two only, one of each sex; after leading
off into the middle of an imaginary circle, and dancing a short
time opposite to each other, the one strives by celerity of steps
in the circumference of the circle to overtake and chase the
other round it; the other in the meantime endeavouring to
maintain an opposite situation by equal celerity in receding.&#8212;Roberts&#8217;

<p>(<i>c</i>) The children join hands and form a ring with one child
standing outside. The ring stands perfectly still throughout this
game and sings the verses, the action being confined to at first
one child, and then to two together. During the singing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_132" id="PageII_132">[132]</a></span>
the first verse the outside child dances round the ring on the
outside. When the ring commences to sing the second verse
the children hold up their arms to form arches, and the child
who has been running round outside runs into the ring under
one pair of joined hands, and out again under the next pair of
arms, continuing this &#8220;in and out&#8221; movement until the third
verse is commenced. The child should try and run in and
out under all the joined hands. At the third verse the child
stops in the ring and stands facing one, whom she chooses for
her lover, until the end of the verse; the chosen child then
leaves the ring, followed by the first child, and they walk round
the ring, or they walk away a little distance, returning at the
commencement of next verse. In the first three versions the
second child is chased back and caught by the first child.
In the <a href="#RoundVillageClapham">Clapham version</a> the two shake hands in the last verse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_133" id="PageII_133">[133]</a></span>
The <a href="#RoundVillageBarnes">Barnes version</a> has kissing for its finale. The <a href="#RoundVillageHanbury">Hanbury</a>
also has kissing, but it precedes the following to London.
In the <a href="#RoundVillageBrigg">Brigg</a>, Lincolnshire (Miss Barker), a child stands in the
middle and points with her finger to each one she passes;
finally selects one, who leaves the ring and kneels in front
of the girl in the middle. At the end of the second verse
the kneeling child gets up and the first child goes in and out
under the arms of the players, followed by the other. At the
fourth they reverse and go back under the arms in the
opposite direction, finally stopping in the middle of the ring,
when another child is chosen and the first one in goes out.
In the <a href="#RoundVillageWinterton">Winterton and Bottesford versions</a> (Miss Peacock), at
the words &#8220;Stand and face your lover,&#8221; the child who has
been going &#8220;in and out&#8221; stands before the one she chooses,
beckons to her, and sings the next verse. Then the chosen
one chases her until she can catch her. In the <a href="#RoundVillageCrockham">Crockham Hill
version</a> (Miss Chase) the love is measured out with a handkerchief
three times, and after kneeling in the road, the chosen
partner follows round the ring and reverses for the return.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The analysis of the game-rhymes is on <a href="#PageII_134">pp. 134-39</a>.
This shows that we are dealing with a game which represents
a village, and also the houses in it. The village only
disappears in six out of the twenty versions. In three of
these (<a href="#RoundVillageHanbury">Hanbury</a>, <a href="#RoundVillageFraserburgh">Fraserburgh</a>, and <a href="#RoundVillageWGrinstead">West Grinstead</a>) the line
has gone altogether. In the fourth (<a href="#RoundVillageBrigg">Lincolnshire</a>) it becomes
&#8220;Round and round and round,&#8221; no mention being made of the
village. In the fifth (<a href="#RoundVillageBelfast">Belfast</a>) the line has become &#8220;Marching
round the ladies.&#8221; In the sixth (<a href="#RoundVillageSettle">Settle</a>) it has become &#8220;Up
and down the valley,&#8221; which also occurs in another imperfect
version, of which a note was sent me by Miss Matthews
from the Forest of Dean, where the line has become &#8220;Round
and round the valley.&#8221; The substitution of &#8220;ladies&#8221; for
&#8220;village&#8221; is very significant as evidence that the game, like
all its compeers, is in a declining stage, and is, therefore,
not the invention of modern times. The idea of a circle of
children representing a village would necessarily be the first
to die out if the game was no longer supported by the influence
of any custom it might represent. The line of decadence becomes in this way an important argument for the discovery
of the original form.</p>

<p>The next incident, No. 10 of the analysis, goes through all
the games except one (West Grinstead), where the very obvious
corruption of &#8220;willows&#8221; for &#8220;windows&#8221; occurs. This incident
takes us to the houses of the village; and thus the two lines
show us a procession, first, going round outside the boundary
of the village, and, secondly, proceeding in serpentine fashion
through the houses. Incident 13 has a few variations which do
not point to anything more than verbal alteration, due to the
changes which have occurred in the conception of the game. Incidents
17 to 22 are not constant to all the versions, and their
variations are of an unimportant character. Incident 27 is
an important element in the game. The prevalence of London
as the place of assignation is probably due to the influence of
that city in the popular mind; but the real significance seems
to be that the lover-husband follows his bride to her own
village. In only two versions is this incident varied (No. 28)
to indicate that the husband took his wife with him, and only
three versions have dropped out the incident altogether.</p>

<p>Abnormal incidents occur in only seven versions, and they
are not of great significance. The <a href="#RoundVillageBrigg">Lincolnshire</a> and <a href="#RoundVillageSporle">Sporle
versions</a> have a line of general introduction (No. 1) before the
game proper begins. Incidents 8 and 9 occur only in the
<a href="#RoundVillageBrigg">Lincolnshire version</a>, and do not disturb the general movement
beyond indicating that the game has become, or is becoming,
an indoor game. Incident 21 is obviously a modern line.
Nos. 26 and 31 suggest a chase after a fugitive pair which,
as they do not occur in other versions, must be considered
as later introductions, belonging, however, to the period when
runaway marriages were more frequent than they are now,
and thus taking us back to, at least, the beginning of this
century; while the significant and pretty variant No. 32 shows
that the game has lost touch with the actual life of the people.
No. 30 in the <a href="#RoundVillageFraserburgh">Fraserburgh version</a> has a suspicious likeness
to a line in the American song &#8220;I&#8217;m off to Charlestown,&#8221; but
as it occurs only in this one version it cannot count as an
important element in the history of the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_141" id="PageII_141">[141]</a></span>(<i>e</i>) Miss Matthews notes a Forest of Dean version. The
children form a ring, singing, &#8220;Round and round the valley,
where we have been before,&#8221; while one child walks round the
outside. Then they stand with uplifted hands, joined together,
and sing, &#8220;In and out of the windows, as we have done
before,&#8221; while the child threads her way in and out of the
ring. Then they sing, &#8220;Stand and face your lover, as we
have done before;&#8221; the child then stands in the centre of
the ring and faces some one, whom she afterwards touches,
and who succeeds her. A version from North Derbyshire
(Mr. S. O. Addy) is practically the same as the <a href="#RoundVillageTean">Tean, North
Staffs. version</a>, except that the third verse is &#8220;Run to meet
your lover,&#8221; instead of &#8220;Stand and face your lover.&#8221; The
first child, during the singing of the third verse, walks round
outside the ring, and touches one she chooses, who then runs
away. While the fourth verse is being sung she is chased
and caught, and the game begins again with the second child
walking round the village. So far as Lancashire is concerned,
Miss Dendy says, &#8220;I have no good evidence as yet that it is
a Lancashire play. I think it has been imported here by
board-school mistresses from other counties.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The burden of this game-rhyme is undoubtedly the oldest
part that has been preserved to modern times. It runs through
all the versions without exception, though variations in the
other lines is shown by the analysis to occur. The words of
the line, &#8220;As we have done before,&#8221; convey the idea of a recurring
event, and inasmuch as that event is undoubtedly marriage,
it seems possible to suggest that we have here a survival of the
periodical village festival at which marriages took place. If the
incidents in the game compare closely with incidents in village
custom, the necessary proof will be supplied, and we will first
examine how far the words of the rhyme and the action of the
game supply us with incidents; and, secondly, how far these
incidents have been kept up in the village custom.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the words to suggest that the incidents
which the game depicts belong to a fixed time, but it is an
important fact that they are alluded to as having previously
taken place. If, then, we have eventually to compare the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_142" id="PageII_142">[142]</a></span>
with a fixed periodical custom, we can at least say that the
rhymes, though not suggesting this, do not oppose it.</p>

<p>This game belongs to the group of &#8220;custom games.&#8221; The
first characteristic which suggests this is that the children,
who join hands and form a circle, are always stationary,
and do not move about as in dance games. To the minds
of the children who play the game, each child in the circle
represents something other than human beings, and this
&#8220;something&#8221; is indicated in the first and second verses,
which speak of the &#8220;windows,&#8221; of houses, and a journey
round &#8220;a village.&#8221; In this game, too, the children, who thus
represent a village, also act as &#8220;chorus,&#8221; for they describe
in the words they sing the various actions of those who are
performing their parts, as in the game of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_6">Old Roger</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this evidence from the game itself, without reference
to anything outside, it is possible to turn to custom to ascertain
if there is anything still extant which might explain the
origin of the game. Children copy the manners and customs
of their elders. If they saw a custom periodically and often
practised with some degree of ceremonial and importance, they
would in their own way act in play what their elders do
seriously.</p>

<p>Such a custom is the perambulation of boundaries, often
associated with festive dances, courtship, and marriage. More
particularly indicative of the origin of the game is the Helston
Furry Dance&#8212;&#8220;About the middle of the day the people collect
together to dance hand-in-hand round the streets, to the sound
of the fiddler playing a particular tune, which they continue to
do till it is dark. This is called a &#8216;Faddy.&#8217; In the afternoon the
gentility go to some farmhouse in the neighbourhood to drink
tea, syllabab, &amp;c., and return in a morrice-dance to the town,
where they form a Faddy and dance through the streets till it
is dark, claiming a right of going through any person&#8217;s house,
in at one door and out at the other.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Gent. Mag. Lib.
Manners and Customs</i>, p. 217. &#8220;In one, if not more, of the
villages,&#8221; says Mr. Gregor (<i>Folk-lore N.E. Scotland</i>, p. 98),
&#8220;when the marriage takes place in the home of the bride the
whole of the marriage party makes the circuit of the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_143" id="PageII_143">[143]</a></span>.&#8221;
In South-Eastern Russia, on the eve of marriage the bride
goes the round of the village, throwing herself on her knees
before the head of each house. In an Indian custom the
bride and bridegroom are conveyed in a particular &#8220;car&#8221;
around the village.&#8212;Gomme, <i>Folk-lore Relics</i>, pp. 214, 215.
According to Valle, a sixteenth century traveller, &#8220;At night
the married couples passed by, and, according to their mode,
went round about the city with a numerous company.&#8221;&#8212;Valle&#8217;s
<i>Travels in India</i> (Hakluyt Soc.), p. 31.<a name="FNanchor2_6" id="FNanchor2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote2_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In these marriage customs there is ample evidence to suggest
that the Indo-European marriage-rite contained just such
features as are represented in this game, and the changes from
rite to popular custom, from popular custom to children&#8217;s
game, do much to suggest consideration of the evidence that
folk-lore supplies.</p>

<p>This game is not mentioned by Halliwell or Chambers, nor,
so far as I am aware, has it been previously printed or recorded
in collections of English games. It appears in America as &#8220;Go
round and round the Valley&#8221; (Newell, <i>Games</i>, p. 128).</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_108" id="GameII_108"></a>Round Tag</h3>

<p>A large ring is formed, two deep, with wide right and left
hand intervals between each couple, and one child stands in
the ring and another outside. When the play begins the
child in the middle runs and places herself in front of one
of the groups of two, thus forming a group of three. Thereupon
the third child, that is, the one standing on the outer
ring, has to run and try to get a place in front of another
two before the one outside the ring can catch her. Then
she who is at the back of this newly-formed three must be on
the alert not to be caught, and must try in her turn to gain
a front place. The one catching has all along to keep outside
the ring, but those trying to escape her may run in and out
and anywhere; whoever is caught has to take the catcher&#8217;s
place.&#8212;Sporle, Norfolk (Miss Matthews).</p>

outside the circle is called the &#8220;clapper;&#8221; it is his

and other places. It is played in precisely the same manner
as at Sporle.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_109" id="GameII_109"></a>Rounders</h3>

<p>This is a boys&#8217; game. A round area is marked out by
boundary sticks, and at a chosen point of the boundary the
base is fixed. This is marked out independently of the
boundary, but inside it. Sides are then chosen. One side are
the &#8220;ins,&#8221; and strike the ball; the other side are the &#8220;outs,&#8221;
and deliver the ball, scout, and endeavour to get their opponents,
the &#8220;ins,&#8221; out as soon as possible. The ball (an indiarubber
one) is delivered by the &#8220;feeder,&#8221; by pitching it to a player,
who stands inside the base armed with a short stick. The
player endeavours to strike the ball as far away as possible from
the fielders or scouts. As soon as the ball is struck away he
runs from the base to the first boundary stick, then to the second,
and so on. His opponents in the meantime secure the ball
and endeavour to hit him with it as he is running from stage to
stage. If he succeeds in running completely round the boundary
before the ball is returned it counts as one rounder. If he is hit
he is out of the game. He can stay at any stage in the boundary
as soon as the ball is in hand, getting home again when
the next player of his own side has in turn hit the ball away.
When a ball is returned the feeder can bounce it within the base,
and the player cannot then run to any new stage of the boundary
until after the ball has again been hit away by another player.
If a player misses a ball when endeavouring to strike at it he
has two more chances, but at the third failure he is bound to
run to the first boundary stick and take his chance of being hit
with the ball. If a ball is caught the whole side is out at once;
otherwise, the side keeps in until either all the players have
been hit out with the ball or until the base is crowned. This
can be done by bouncing the ball in the base whenever there
is no player there to receive the delivery from the feeder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_146" id="PageII_146">[146]</a></span>
When a complete rounder is obtained, the player has the privilege
either of counting the rounder to the credit of his side, or
of ransoming one of the players who have been hit out, who
then takes his part in the game as before. When all but one
of the players are &#8220;out,&#8221; this last player in hitting the ball must
hit it away so as to be able to make a rounder, and return to
the base before his opponents get back the ball to crown the base.</p>

<p>An elaborate form of this game has become the national game
of the United States.</p>

<p>An equal number of players is chosen on each side. Two
chiefs are chosen by lot. One of the chiefs takes his stand
by a wall, and all his party bend their backs, joined in a line.
One of the opposite side leaps on the back of the one farthest
from the one standing at the wall, and tries to make his way
over the backs of all the stooping boys, up to the one standing.
Those stooping move and wriggle to cast him off, and if they
succeed in doing so, he stands aside till all his side have tried.
When all have tried and none succeed in crowning the one
standing, the sides change. If one or more succeed, then each
such has a second chance before the sides change. Each side
commonly has six chances. The side that succeeds in oftenest
touching the chief&#8217;s head wins the game.&#8212;Dyke (Rev. W.

<p>(<i>c</i>) A ring is formed by the children joining hands. One
girl kneels or sits down in the centre, and covers her face with
her hands as if weeping. The ring dances round and sings
the words. The child in the centre rises when the command is
given, and chooses a boy or girl from the ring, who goes into
the centre with her. These two kiss together when the words are
said. The child who was first in the centre then joins the ring,
the second remaining in the centre, and the game continues.</p>

<p>All versions of this game are played in the same way, except
slight variations in a few instances. Kissing does not prevail
in all the versions. In the <a href="#SallyEHeaton1">Earls Heaton game</a>, the child who
kneels in the centre also pretends to weep and dries her tears
before choosing a partner. Miss Burne, in <i>Shropshire Folklore</i>,
says the girl kneels disconsolately in the middle of the
ring. In the <a href="#SallyStixwould">Stixwould version</a>, the child stands in the centre
holding in her hands something resembling a saucer; she then
pretends to &#8220;knock it in a mortar,&#8221; and gives the saucer to the
one whom she chooses. This one exchanges places with her.
In the <a href="#SallyMaxey">Northants version</a>, at the words &#8220;clash the bells,&#8221; the
children dash down their joined hands to imitate ringing bells.
Addy, <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>, says one girl sits in the middle
weeping. When the girl has chosen, the young man remains
in the centre, and the word &#8220;Sally&#8221; is changed to &#8220;Billy,&#8221; or
some other name, and &#8220;man&#8221; to &#8220;girl.&#8221; In the <a href="#SallyBeddgelert">Beddgelert
version</a>, the centre child wipes her eyes with a handkerchief in
the beginning of the game. Several other versions have been
sent me, all being the same as those printed here, or varying
so slightly, it is unnecessary to repeat them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_174" id="PageII_174">[174]</a></span>The first thing to note from this analysis are the words
Sally and Water. In twenty-three versions they are Sally
Water or Waters, in seventeen versions it is Sally Walker, in
six versions it is another name altogether, while in two versions
it is Sallie only. The most constant name, therefore, points to
Sally Water as the oldest version; and it is noticeable that
in the <a href="#SallyStixwould">Lincolnshire</a> and <a href="#SallyAddy2">Sheffield versions</a>, where the name is
not Sally Water, the word water is introduced later on in the
line which directs the action of sprinkling water. Is it possible,
then, that Sally Water may be a corruption from an earlier
form where Sally is some other word, not the name of a girl,
as it is usually supposed to be, and the word water is connected,
not with the name of the maiden, but with the action
of sprinkling which she is called upon to perform? If we
could surmise that the early form was &#8220;Sallie, Sallie, water
sprinkle in the pan,&#8221; the accusative being placed before
the verb, the problem would be solved in this manner; but
there is no warrant for this poetical licence in popular verses,
and I prefer to suggest that &#8220;water&#8221; got attached as a surname
by simple transposition, such as the <a href="#SallyNorfolk">Norfolk</a> and <a href="#SallyBeddgelert">Beddgelert
versions</a> allow as evidence. It follows from this that
Walker and other names appear as degraded forms of the
original, and do not enter into the question of origins, a point
which may readily be conceded, considering that the general
evidence of all these singing games is, that no special names
are ever used, but that names change to suit the players. The
next incident in the analysis is the ceremony of &#8220;sprinkling
the water,&#8221; which is constant in twenty-one versions, while the
<a href="#SallyWakefield">Wakefield</a> &#8220;Springin&#8217; in the pan,&#8221; the <a href="#SallySettle">Settle</a> &#8220;Tinkle in a can,&#8221;
<a href="#SallyHalliwell">Halliwell&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Sprinkle for a young man,&#8221; and the eight versions
in which this incident is wholly absent in any form, are evident
corruptions. The tendency of the corruption is shown by this
to be that the &#8220;sprinkling of water&#8221; came to be omitted from
the verse, and therefore the other variants<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li>Sitting by the water (<a href="#SallyAddy2">Sheffield</a>),</li>
<li>Water your can (<a href="#SallyLItchington">Warwickshire</a>),</li>
<li>Sitting in a sigh (<a href="#SallyNairn1">Nairn</a>),</li>
<li>Sitting on the sand (<a href="#SallyFraserburgh">Fraserburgh</a> and <a href="#SallyBeddgelert">Beddgelert</a>).</li>

<li>Sitting on the ground (<a href="#SallyNotts">Notts.</a>),</li>
</ul>

<p>are but the steps through which the entire omission of the
water incident was finally attained. The third incident is
&#8220;Rise and choose&#8221; a young man, the alternative being &#8220;Crying
for a young man.&#8221; The first indicates a kneeling and
reverential attitude before the water, and occurs in twenty-one
versions, while the second only occurs in fourteen versions.</p>

<p>The expression &#8220;crying&#8221; is really to &#8220;announce a want,&#8221;
as &#8220;wants&#8221; were formerly cried by the official &#8220;crier&#8221; of
every township, and indeed as children still in games &#8220;cry&#8221;
the forfeits; but losing this meaning, the expression came to
mean crying in the sense of &#8220;weeping,&#8221; and appearing to the
minds of children as a natural way of expressing a want, would
therefore succeed in ousting any more archaic notion. The
incident of crying for a lover appears in other singing games,
as, for instance, in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_51">Poor Mary</a>.&#8221; Especially may this be considered
the process which has been going on when it is seen
that &#8220;choosing&#8221; is an actual incident of the game, even in
those cases where &#8220;crying&#8221; has replaced the kneeling. The
choosing incident also assumes two forms, namely, with respect
to &#8220;east and west&#8221; in twenty-two versions, and &#8220;best and
worst&#8221; in nine versions. Now, the expression, &#8220;for better for
worse,&#8221; is an old marriage formula preserved in the vernacular
portion of the ancient English marriage service (see Palgrave,
<i>English Commonwealth</i>, ii., p. cxxxvi.); and I cannot but think
that we have the same formula in this game, especially as the
final admonition in nearly all the versions is to choose &#8220;the
one loved best.&#8221; Following upon this comes the very general
marriage formula noted so frequently in these games. It is
slightly varied in some versions, and is replaced by a different
formula, but one that also appears in other games, in two or
three versions. One feature is very noticeable in the less
common versions of this game, viz., the assumption of the
marriage being connected with the birth of children, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_176" id="PageII_176">[176]</a></span>
indulgences of the lovers, as in the Tong and Scottish versions
<a href="#SallyGregor">xxxii.</a>, <a href="#SallyTyrie">xxxiii.</a>, and <a href="#SallyCullen">xxxiv.</a></p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) In considering the probable origin of the game, the
first thing will be to ascertain as far as possible what ideas
the words are intended to convey. Taking note of the
results of the analysis, so far as they show the corruptions
which have taken place in the words, it seems clear that though
it is not possible to restore the original words, their original
meaning is still preserved. This is, that they accompanied the
performance of a marriage ceremony, and that a chief feature of
this ceremony was connected with some form of water-worship,
or some rite in which water played a chief part. Now it has
been noted before that the games of children have preserved,
by adaptation, the marriage ceremony of ancient times (<i>e.g.</i>,
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_415">Merry ma Tansa</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_445">Nuts in May</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_51">Poor Mary</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_106">Round and
Round the Village</a>&#8221;); but this is the first instance where such
an important particularisation as that implied by water-worship
qualifies the marriage ceremony. It is therefore necessary to see
what this exactly means. Mr. Hartland, in his <i>Perseus</i> (i. 167-9),
draws attention to the general significance of the water ceremonial
in marriage customs, and Mr. F. B. Jevons, in his introduction
to Plutarch&#8217;s <i>Romane Questions</i>, and in the <i>Transactions
of the Folk-lore Congress</i>, 1891, deals with the subject in reference
to the origin of custom obtaining among both Aryan and
non-Aryan speaking people. In this connection an important
consideration arises. The Esthonian brides, on the morning
after the wedding, are taken to make offerings to the water
spirit, and they throw offerings into the spring (or a vessel of
water), overturn a vessel of water in the house, and sprinkle
their bridegrooms with water. The Hindoo offerings of the bride
were cast into a water vessel, and the bride sprinkles the court of
the new house with water by way of exorcism, and also sprinkles
the bridegroom (Jevons, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 345). Here the parallel between
the non-Aryan Esthonian custom and the Aryan Hindoo
custom is very close, and it is a part of Mr. Jevons&#8217; argument
that, among the Teutons, with whom alone of Aryan speaking
peoples the Esthonians came into contact, the custom was limited
to the bride simply stepping over a vessel of water. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_177" id="PageII_177">[177]</a></span>
certainly something a great deal more than the parallel to the
Teutonic custom in the game of &#8220;Sally, Sally Water,&#8221; and as it
equates more nearly to Hindoo and Esthonian custom, the question
is, Does it help Mr. Jevons in the important point he raises?
I think it does. A custom is very low down among the strata of
survivals when it is only to be recognised as part of a children&#8217;s
singing game, and the proposition it suggests is that children
have preserved more of the old custom than was preserved by
the people who adopted a portion of it into their marriage
ceremony. A custom so treated must be older than the
marriage ceremony with which it thus came into contact, and
if this is a true conclusion, we have in this children&#8217;s game a
relic of the pre-Celtic peoples of these islands&#8212;a relic therefore
going back many centuries for its origin, and which is of inestimable
service in discussing some important problems of the
ethnic significance of folk-lore. These conclusions are entirely
derived from the significant position which this game occupies
in relation to Esthonian (non-Aryan) and to Teutonic (Aryan)
marriage customs respectively, and therefore it is of considerable
importance to note that it entirely fits in with the conclusion
which my husband has drawn as to the non-Aryan origin of
water-worship (see Gomme&#8217;s <i>Ethnology of Folk-lore</i>, pp. 79-105).</p>

<p>There is, however, something further which seems to bring
this game into line with non-Aryan marriage customs. The
marriage signified by the game is acknowledged and sanctioned
by the presence of witnesses; is made between two people
who choose each other without any form of compulsion; is
accompanied by blessings upon the young couple and prognostications
of the birth of children. These points show that the
marriage ceremony belongs to a time when the object of the
union was to have children, and when its duration was not
necessarily for life. It is curious to note that water worship is
distinctly connected with the desire to have children (<i>Proc.
Roy. Irish Acad.</i>, 3rd ser., ii. 9); and that the idea of the
temporary character of the marriage status of the lower classes
of the people is still extant I have certain evidence of. Early
in November of 1895, a man tried for bigamy gave as his
defence that he thought his marriage was ended with his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_178" id="PageII_178">[178]</a></span>
wife, as he had been away seven years. It is a frequently
told story. A year and a day and seven years are the two
periods for which the popular mind regards marriage binding.
&#8220;I was faithful to him for seven years, and had more
than my two children,&#8221; a woman said to me once, as if two
children were the required or expected number to be born
in that period. If there is a popular belief of this kind, it is
strangely borne out by this game-rhyme. &#8220;First a girl, and
then a boy,&#8221; may also be shown to be a result to be desired
and prayed for, in the popular belief that a man&#8217;s cycle of life is
not complete until he is the father of a daughter, who, in her turn,
shall have a son. Miss Hawkins Dempster obtained evidence
of such a belief from the lips of a man who considered he was
entitled to marry another woman, as his wife had only borne
him sons, and therefore his life was not (like hers) complete.</p>

<p>The free choice of both woman and man is opposed to the
theory of our present marriage ceremony, where permission or
authority to marry is only necessary for the woman, the man
being able to do as he pleases. This is now regarded as
a sign of women&#8217;s early subjection to the authority of men and
their subordinate place in the household. But it does not
follow that this was the relative position of men and women
when a ceremony was first found needful and instituted. I
am inclined to think it must have been, rather, the importance
attached to the woman&#8217;s act of ratification, in the presence of
witnesses, of her formal promise to bear children to a particular
man. Marriage would then consist of contracts between
two parties for the purpose of, and which actually resulted
in, the birth of children; of concubinage, or the wife consenting
to children being born to her husband by another woman
in her stead, if she herself failed in this respect (such children
being hers and her husband&#8217;s jointly); of marriage without
ceremony or set purpose, resulting from young people being
thrown together at feast times, gathering in of harvests, &amp;c.,
which might or might not result in the birth of children.
These conditions of the marriage rite are at variance with what
we know of the Aryan marriage generally and its results; and
that they flow from the customs preserved in the game under<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_179" id="PageII_179">[179]</a></span>
consideration is further proof of the origin of the game from a
marriage rite of the pre-Celtic people of these islands. The
&#8220;kissing together&#8221; of the married couple is the token to the
witnesses of their mutual consent to the contract.</p>

<p>Attention has already been directed to the fact that parts of
the formula preserved in this game are also found in other
games, and it may possibly be assumed therefrom that the
same origin must be given to these games as to &#8220;Sally Water.&#8221;
The objection to such a conclusion is mainly that it is impossible
to decide to which game the popular marriage formula originally
belonged, and from which it has been borrowed by the other
games. Seeing how exactly it fits the circumstances of &#8220;Sally
Water,&#8221; it might not be too much to suggest that it rightly
belongs to this game. Another point to be noted is that the tune
to which the words of the marriage formula are sung is always
the same, irrespective of that to which the previous verses are
sung, and this rule obtains in all those games in which this
formula appears&#8212;a further proof of the antiquity of the formula
as an outcome of the early marriage ceremony.<span class="addmark"><a href="#Add_76">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>Letting their arms fall they enclose a boy and ask him to

to his own decision. The parties being at length formed, are
separated by a real or imaginary line, and place at some
distance behind them, in a heap, their hats, coats, &amp;c. They
stand opposite to each other, the object being to make a
successful incursion over the line into the enemy&#8217;s country,
and bring off part of the heap of clothes. It requires both
address and swiftness of foot to do so without being taken by
the foe. The winning of the game is decided by which party

<p>The following version was written down in 1821 under the
name of Scotch and English:&#8212;Two parties of boys, divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_184" id="PageII_184">[184]</a></span>
by a fixed line, endeavoured to pull one another across this
line, or to seize by bodily strength or nimbleness a &#8220;wad&#8221;
(the coats or hats of the players) from the little heap
deposited in the different territories at a convenient distance.
The person pulled across or seized in his attempt
to rob the camp was made a prisoner and conducted to the
enemy&#8217;s station, where he remained under the denomination
of &#8220;stinkard&#8221; till relieved by one of the same side, or by
a general exchange of prisoners.&#8212;<i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
August 1821, p. 25. The <i>Denham Tracts</i>, i. 150, gives a
version of the game much the same as these, except that
the words used by the English are, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a leap into thy
kingdom, dry-bellied Scot.&#8221; See also Hutton&#8217;s <i>History of
Roman Wall</i> (1804), p. 104. Brockett&#8217;s account, under the
title of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_173">Stealy Clothes</a>, or Watch Webs,&#8221; is as follows:&#8212;The
players divide into two parties and draw a line as the
boundary of their respective territories. At an equal distance
from this line each player deposits his hat or some other
article of his dress. The object of the game is to seize and
convey these singly to your own store from that of the enemy,
but if you are unfortunately caught in the attempt, you not
only restore the plunder but become a prisoner yourself.
This evidently takes its origin from the inroads of the English
and Scotch; indeed, it is plainly proved from the language
used on the occasion, which consists in a great measure of
the terms of reproach still common among the Borderers.&#8212;Brockett&#8217;s
<i>North Country Words</i>.</p>

<p>Jamieson, also, describes the game under the title of

<p>A common game, children sitting on either end of a
plank supported on its centre, and made to rock up and
down. While enjoying this recreation, they sing the verse.
Addy, <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>, gives Ranty or Rantypole, a plank
or pole balanced evenly, upon which children rock up and
down in see-saw fashion. Jamieson, <i>Etymological Dictionary</i>,
gives Coup-the-Ladle as the name for See-saw in Aberdeen.
Moor, <i>Suffolk Words and Phrases</i>, describes this
game, and gives the same words to be sung while playing
as Halliwell&#8217;s above. Grose gives &#8220;Weigh,&#8221; to play at See-saw.
Holloway, <i>Dictionary of Provincialisms</i>, says, in Norfolk
See-saw is called Titti cum Totter; and in Gainford, Durham,
Ewiggy Shog. Halliwell gives versions of <a href="#SeeSawLondon1">Nos. II.</a> and <a href="#SeeSawLondon2">III.</a>
in his <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, and also other verses with the opening
words &#8220;See-saw,&#8221; namely, &#8220;See-saw, Jack-a-Daw,&#8221; &#8220;See-saw,
Sack-a-day;&#8221; but these are not connected with the
game by Halliwell, and there is nothing in the words to
indicate such a connection. Mactaggart, <i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>,
calls the game &#8220;Coggle-te-Carry,&#8221; but gives no
verses, and Strutt calls it &#8220;<a href="#GameII_218">Titter Totter</a>.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Sports</i>, p. 303.
He does not give any rhymes, except to quote Gay&#8217;s poem,
but it is possible that the rhyme to his game may be <a href="#SeeSawHalliwell1">No. I.</a>
Brogden gives &#8220;Hightte&#8221; as the game of See-saw. The <a href="#SeeSawMan">Manx
version</a> has not before been published, and Mr. Moore says is
now quite forgotten in the Isle. The game is called &#8220;Shuggy-shoo&#8221;
in Irish, and also &#8220;Copple-thurrish,&#8221; evidently &#8220;Horse
and Pig,&#8221; as if the two animals were balancing against each
other, and alternately becoming elevated and depressed.&#8212;<i>Ulster
Journ. Arch.</i>, vi. 102. The child who stands on the
plank in the centre and balances it, is frequently called the
&#8220;canstick&#8221; or &#8220;candlestick.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_135" id="GameII_135"></a>Shame Reel, or Shamit Dance</h3>

<p>In several counties of Scotland this was the name of the
first dance after the celebration of marriages. It was performed
by the bride and best man and the bridegroom and best maid.
The bride&#8217;s partner asked what was to be the &#8220;sham spring,&#8221;
and she commonly answered, &#8220;Through the world will I gang
wi&#8217; the lad that lo&#8217;es me,&#8221; which, on being communicated to the
fiddlers, was struck up, and the dance went on somewhat
punctiliously, while the guests looked on in silence, and greeted
the close with applause. This dance was common in Forfarshire
twenty years ago.&#8212;Jamieson&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_136" id="GameII_136"></a>She Said, and She Said</h3>

<p>This game requires two confederates; one leaves the room,
and the other in the secret asks a player in the room to whisper
to him whom she (or he) loved; he then calls in his companion,
and the following dialogue is carried on:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;She said, and she said!<br /></span>

<span class="i00">&#8220;No! she never said that, whatever she said.&#8221;<br /></span>

<p>An indefinite number of names are mentioned before the right one.

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Yes! she said that.&#8221;<br /></span>

<p>The secret was very simple; the name of a widow or widower
known to both players was always given before that whispered.&#8212;Cornwall

<h3><a name="GameII_137" id="GameII_137"></a>Shepherd and Sheep</h3>

<p>Children choose, by &#8220;counting out,&#8221; or otherwise, a Shepherd
and a Wolf (or Mother Sheep, and Wolf). The Wolf
goes away, and the rest of the players are the Sheep (or Lambs)
and stand in a row. The Shepherd counts them&#8212;Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, &amp;c. Then<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;What shall I bring home for you for dinner,
Sunday, I&#8217;m going to market?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_188" id="PageII_188">[188]</a></span>Sunday chooses something&#8212;roast veal, apple tart, or anything
else that she likes. Then Monday, Tuesday, and the
rest choose also. Shepherd goes away, saying<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Mind you are all good children.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Wolf comes directly the Shepherd goes out of sight,
and takes away one of the Sheep. Shepherd comes back and
begins to distribute the different things<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Sunday, Monday,&#8212;&#8212;why, where&#8217;s Tuesday?&#8221; (or Wednesday, as the case may be.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The Children cry in chorus<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Old Wolf came down the chimney and took him (or her) away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This formula is repeated till all the children (sheep) are stolen.</p>

<p>The Shepherd now goes to the Wolf&#8217;s house to look for his
sheep<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;Good morning, have you seen my sheep?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i>&#8212;&#8220;Yes, they went down Red Lane.&#8221;</p>

<p>[Shepherd looks down Red Lane.]</p>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ve been down Red Lane, and they&#8217;re not there.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i>&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ve just seen them pass, they&#8217;re gone down Green Lane,&#8221;
&amp;c. These questions and answers continue as long as the
children&#8217;s fancy holds out; then the Shepherd comes back.</p>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ve looked everywhere, and can&#8217;t find them. I
b&#8217;lieve you&#8217;ve got them? I smell meat; may I go up and
taste your soup?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i>&#8212;&#8220;You can&#8217;t go upstairs, your shoes are too dirty.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ll take off my shoes&#8221; (pretends to take them off).</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i>&#8212;&#8220;Your stockings are too dirty.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ll take off my stockings&#8221; (suits the action).</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i>&#8212;&#8220;Your feet are too dirty.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ll cut my feet off&#8221; (pretends to cut them off).</p>

<p>(Milder version, &#8220;I&#8217;ll wash my feet.&#8221;)</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i>&#8212;&#8220;Then the blood&#8217;ll run about.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Milder version, &#8220;Then they&#8217;ll wet my carpet.&#8221;)</p>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ll tie up my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Or, &#8220;I&#8217;ll wipe my feet&#8221;)</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i>&#8212;-&#8220;Well, now you may go up.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Shepherd</i>&#8212;&#8220;I smell my sheep.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_189" id="PageII_189">[189]</a></span>The Shepherd then goes to one child, pretends to taste&#8212;using
fingers of both hands as though holding a spoon and fork&#8212;on
the top of the child&#8217;s head, saying, &#8220;That&#8217;s my sheep,&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s Tuesday,&#8221; &amp;c., till he comes to the end of the row,
then they all shout out and rush home to the fold, the Wolf
with them. A fresh Shepherd and Wolf are chosen, and the
game starts once more.&#8212;Cornwall (Miss I. Barclay).</p>

<p>One player is chosen to be the Shepherd, another the Thief,
and the rest the sheep, who are arranged in a long row. The
Shepherd pretends to be asleep; the Thief takes away one of
the sheep and hides it; he then says<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The Shepherd counts the sheep, and missing one, asks
where it is gone. The Thief says, &#8220;It is gone to get fat!&#8221;
The Shepherd goes to sleep again, and the same performance
is repeated till all the sheep are hidden; the Shepherd goes
in search of them, and when found they join him in the
pursuit of the Thief.&#8212;Oswestry (Burne&#8217;s <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>,
p. 520).</p>

<p>Mr. Northall (<i>Folk Rhymes</i>, p. 391) gives a version from
Warwickshire, and says he believes the Shepherd&#8217;s dog to be

<h3><a name="GameII_139" id="GameII_139"></a>Shinney, or Shinty, or Shinnops</h3>

<p>A writer in <i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine</i>, August 1821, p. 36, says:
The boys attempt to drive with curved sticks a ball, or what
is more common, part of the vertebral bone of a sheep, in
opposite directions. When the object driven along reaches the
appointed place in either termination, the cry of hail! stops
the play till it is knocked off anew by the boy who was so
fortunate as to drive it past the gog. In the Sheffield district
it is played as described by Halliwell. During the game the
boys call out, &#8220;Hun you, shin you.&#8221; It is called Shinny in
Derbyshire.&#8212;Addy&#8217;s <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>. Halliwell&#8217;s description
does not materially differ from the account given above
except that when the knur is down over the line it is called a
&#8220;bye.&#8221;&#8212;(<i>Dictionary</i>). In <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 8th series, viii.
446; ix. 115 <i>et seq.</i>, the game is described as played in Lincolnshire
under the name of &#8220;Cabsow,&#8221; which perhaps accounts for
the Barnes game of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_161">Crab-sowl</a>.</p>

<p>In Perthshire it is described as a game in which bats somewhat
resembling a golf club are used. At every fair or meeting
of the country people there were contests at racing,
wrestling, putting the stone, &amp;c., and on holidays all the males
of a district, young and old, met to play at football, but oftener
at shinty.&#8212;<i>Perthshire Statistical Account</i>, v. 72; Jamieson&#8217;s
description is the same.</p>

<p>Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> says: A game described
by Scotch writers by the name of Shintie; the shins,
or under parts of the legs, are in danger during the game of
being struck, hence the name from shin.&#8212;Dickinson, <i>Cumberland
Glossary</i>, mentions Shinny as a boyish game, also called
Scabskew, catty; it is also the name of the crook-ended stick
used in the game. Patterson, <i>Antrim and Down Glossary</i>,
under name Shinney, says, This game is played with shinneys,
<i>i.e.</i>, hooked sticks, and a ball or small block of wood called the
&#8220;Golley,&#8221; or &#8220;Nag.&#8221;</p>

<p>In London this game is called <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_298">Hockey</a>. It seems to be the
same which is designed <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_442">Not</a></i> in Gloucestershire; the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_191" id="PageII_191">[191]</a></span>
being borrowed from the ball, which is made of a knotty piece
of wood.&#8212;Grose&#8217;s <i>Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>It has been said that Shinty and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_298">Hockey</a> differ in this
respect, that in the latter two goals are erected, each being
formed by a piece of stick with both ends stuck in the ground.
The players divide into two parties; to each of these the care
of one of the goals belongs. The game consists in endeavouring
to drive the ball through the goal of the opposite party.&#8212;<i>Book
of Sports</i> (1810), pp. 11-13. But in Shinty there are
also two goals, called hails; the object of each party being
to drive the ball beyond their own hail, but there is no hole
through which it must be driven. The ball, or knot of wood,
is called Shintie.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_140" id="GameII_140"></a>Ship</h3>

<p>A boy&#8217;s game. It is played in two ways&#8212;(1) Of a single
character. One boy bends down against a wall (sometimes
another stands pillow for his head), then an opponent jumps
on his back, crying &#8220;Ships&#8221; simply, or &#8220;Ships a-sailing,
coming on.&#8221; If he slips off, he has to bend as the other;
but if not, he can remain as long as he pleases, provided he
does not laugh or speak. If he forgets to cry &#8220;Ships,&#8221; he has
to bend down. (2) Sometimes sides are chosen; then the
whole side go down heads and tails, and all the boys on the
other side have to jump on their backs. The game in each
case is much the same. The &#8220;naming&#8221; was formerly &#8220;Ships
and sailors coming on.&#8221;&#8212;Easther&#8217;s <i>Almondbury Glossary</i>. Mr.
H. Hardy sends an account from Earls Heaton, which is practically
the same as these.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_141" id="GameII_141"></a>Ship Sail</h3>

<p>A game usually played with marbles. One boy puts his
hand into his trousers pocket and takes out as many marbles
as he feels inclined; he closes his fingers over them, and holds
out his hand with the palm down to the opposite player, saying,
&#8220;Ship sail, sail fast. How many men on board?&#8221; A guess is
made by his opponent; if less he has to give as many marbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_192" id="PageII_192">[192]</a></span>
as will make up the true number; if more, as many as he said
over. But should the guess be correct he takes them, and
then in his turn says, &#8220;Ship sail,&#8221; &amp;c.&#8212;Cornwall (<i>Folk-lore
Journal</i>, v. 59).</p>

steady himself until he goes through a number of antics; if
he can do this he shoes the auld mare, if he cannot do it he
generally tumbles to the ground and gets hurt with the fall.&#8212;Mactaggart&#8217;s

those under her protection, perhaps to the number of a dozen,
keep all in a string behind her, each holding by the tail of one
another. The Gled still tries to catch the last of them, while
the mother cries &#8220;Shue! Shue!&#8221; spreading out her arms to
keep him off. If he catch all the birds he wins the game.&#8212;Fife,

<p>This game is generally known as &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_35">Battledore and Shuttlecock</a>.&#8221;
The battledore is a small hand bat, formerly made of
wood, then of a skin stretched over a frame, and since of catgut
strings stretched over a frame. The shuttlecock consists of a
small cork into which feathers of equal size are fixed at even
distances. The game may be played by one, two, or more
persons. If by one person, it merely consists of batting up
the shuttlecock into the air for as long a time as possible; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_193" id="PageII_193">[193]</a></span>
by two persons, it consists of batting the shuttlecock from one
to the other; if by more than two, sides are chosen, and a
game has been invented, and known as &#8220;Badminton.&#8221; This
latter game is not a traditional game, and does not therefore
concern us now.</p>

<p>Strutt (<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 303) says this is a sport of
long standing, and he gives an illustration, said to be of the
fourteenth century, from a MS. in the possession of Mr. F.
Douce. This would probably be the earliest mention of the
game. It appears to have been a fashionable pastime among
grown persons in the reign of James I. In the <i>Two Maids
of Moreclacke</i>, 1609, it is said, &#8220;To play at Shuttlecock
methinkes is the game now,&#8221; and among the anecdotes related
of Prince Henry, son to James I., is the following: &#8220;His
Highness playing at shittle-cocke with one farr taller than
himself, and hittyng him by chance with the shittle-cock upon
the forehead&#8221; (<i>Harl. MS.</i>, 6391). Among the accounts of
money paid for the Earl of Northumberland while he was
prisoner in the Tower for supposed complicity in the Gunpowder
Plot, is an item for the purchase of shuttlecocks (<i>Hist.
MSS. Com.</i>, v. p. 354).</p>

<p>But the popular nature of the game is not indicated by these
facts. For this we have to turn to the doings of the people.
In the villages of the West Riding the streets may be seen on
the second Sunday in May full of grown-up men and women
playing &#8220;Battledore and Shuttlefeathers&#8221; (Henderson&#8217;s <i>Folk-lore
of the Northern Counties</i>, p. 80). In Leicester the approach
of Shrove Tuesday (known amongst the youngsters as &#8220;Shuttlecock
Day&#8221;) is signalised by the appearance in the streets of
a number of children playing at the game of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_35">Battledore and
Shuttlecock</a>.&#8221; On the day itself the streets literally swarm
with juveniles, and even grown men and women engage in
the pastime. Passing through a by-street the other day I
heard a little girl singing<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_194" id="PageII_194">[194]</a></p>

<p>The occurrence of this rhyme suggests that there is some
sort of divination in the oldest form of the game, and it appears
to me that the origin of the game must be sought for among
the ancient practices of divination. An example is found
among the customs of the children of Glamorganshire during
the cowslip season. The cowslip heads are strung on a piece
of thread and tied into a &#8220;posty,&#8221; and the play is to throw it
up a tolerable height, catching it on the distended palm with a
blow that sends it up again, while the player sings:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pisty, posty, four and forty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many years shall I live?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One, two, three, four, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of course, if it falls to the ground uncaught, or even if caught
in the clenched hand, there is an end of the player&#8217;s &#8220;life.&#8221;
There is a good deal of emulation amongst the children as to
who shall live the longest (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3rd ser., iii. 172).
Miss Burne (<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 530) mentions the same
custom, giving the rhyme as<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Toss-a-ball, toss-a-ball, tell me true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many years I&#8217;ve got to go through,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and she says the cowslip is thence called a &#8220;tissy-ball.&#8221; In
this custom we have no artificial aids to form a game, but we
have a significant form of divination from natural flowers,
accompanied by a rhyming formula exactly parallel to the
rhymes used in the Leicestershire game of &#8220;Shuttlecock,&#8221; and
I conclude therefore that we have here the true origin of the
game. This conclusion is confirmed when it is found that divinatory
verses generally accompany the popular form of the game.</p>

<p class="source">&#8212;Dublin (Mrs. Lincoln).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The children form a ring, joining hands. A child, usually
a boy, stands in the middle. The ring dances round and sings
the verses. The boy in the centre chooses a girl when bidden
by the ring. These two then stand in the centre and kiss
each other at the command. The boy then takes a place in
the ring, and the girl remains in the centre and chooses a boy
in her turn. In the <a href="#SillyDublin">Dublin</a> and <a href="#SillyMan">Isle of Man versions</a> a girl is
first in the centre; in the <a href="#SillyMan">Manx version</a> (A. W. Moore) the
two children hold hands when in the centre.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) In the <i>Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry</i>, Mr.
Carleton gives this game as one of those played by young
people of both sexes at funeral wakes. It is played in the
same way as the game now is; boys and girls stand alternately
in a ring holding hands, choosing each other in turn, and kissing.
The other versions do not differ materially from each other,
except that the Lancashire version described by Miss Dendy
has evidently been corrupted quite lately, because a <a href="#SillyLancashire">purer form</a>
is quoted from the same county in <i>Notes and Queries</i>. The
game seems to be one of the group of marriage games arising
from the fact that at any gathering of people for the purpose
of a ceremonial, whether a funeral or a festival, it was the
custom to form matrimonial alliances. The words are used for
kiss-in-the-ring games, and also in some marriage games when
the last player is left without a partner.</p>

Another boy stoops with his head in the breast of the one standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_200" id="PageII_200">[200]</a></span>
upright. A third boy jumps stride-leg on his back, and
tries to &#8220;crown,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, put his hand on the head of the boy at
the wall. The boy on whose back he is tries every means by
shifting from side to side, and by throwing up his back, to prevent
him from doing so, and to cast him off. If he succeeds in
doing so, he takes his stand behind the stooping boy in the same
position. Another boy then tries to do the same thing over
the two stooping boys. If he succeeds in crowning the standing
boy, he takes his station at the wall. If not, he takes his
stand behind the two stooping boys. The game goes on till a
boy &#8220;crowns&#8221; the one standing at the wall.&#8212;Banchory (Rev.

<h3><a name="GameII_149" id="GameII_149"></a>Skipping</h3>

<p>Strutt says (<i>Sports</i>, p. 383), &#8220;This amusement is probably
very ancient. Boys often contend for superiority of skill in
this game, and he who passes the rope about most times
without interruption is the conqueror. In the hop season a
hop-stem, stripped of its leaves, is used instead of a rope, and,
in my opinion, it is preferable.&#8221; On Good Friday on Brighton
beach the fisher folk used to play at skipping, six to ten
grown-up people skipping at one rope.</p>

<p>Apart from the ordinary, and probably later way of playing,
by one child holding a rope in both hands, turning it over the
head, and either stepping over it while running, or standing
still and jumping until the feet catch the rope and a trip is
made, skipping appears to be performed in two ways, jumping
or stepping across with (1) more or less complicated movements
of the rope and feet, and (2) the ordinary jumping over a turned
rope while chanting rhymes, for the purpose of deciding whether
the players are to be married or single, occupation of future
husband, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of the first class of game there are the following variants:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Pepper, salt, mustard, cider, vinegar.&#8221;&#8212;Two girls turn
the rope slowly at first, repeating the above words, then they
turn it as quickly as possible until the skipper is tired out,
or trips.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_201" id="PageII_201">[201]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Rock the Cradle.&#8221;&#8212;In this the holders of the rope do not
throw it completely over, but swing it from side to side with an
even motion like the swinging of the pendulum of a clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chase the Fox.&#8221;&#8212;One girl is chosen as a leader, or fox.
The first runs through the rope, as it is turned towards her,
without skipping; the others all follow her; then she runs
through from the other side as the rope is turned from her, and
the others follow. Then she runs in and jumps or skips once,
and the others follow suit; then she skips twice and runs
out, then three times, the others all following in turn until one
trips or fails. The first one to do this takes the place of one of
the turners, the turner taking her place as one of the skippers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Visiting.&#8221;&#8212;One girl turns the rope over herself, and another
jumps in and faces her, while skipping in time with the girl she
visits. She then runs out again without stopping the rope,
and another girl runs in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Begging.&#8221;&#8212;Two girls turn, and two others run and skip
together side by side. While still skipping they change places;
one says, as she passes, &#8220;Give me some bread and butter;&#8221;
the other answering, &#8220;Try my next door neighbour.&#8221; This is
continued until one trips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winding the Clock.&#8221;&#8212;Two turn the rope, and the skipper
counts one, two, three, up to twelve, turning round each time
she jumps or skips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baking Bread.&#8221;&#8212;Two girls turn, and another runs in with
a stone in her hand, which she puts down on the ground, and
picks up again while skipping.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Ladder.&#8221;&#8212;The girls run in to skip, first on one foot
and then the other, with a stepping motion.</p>

<p>Two other games are as follows:&#8212;(1.) Two ropes are used,
and a girl holds either end in each hand, turning them alternately;
the skipper has to jump or skip over each in turn.
When the rope is turned inwards, it is called &#8220;double dutch,&#8221;
when turned outwards, &#8220;French dutch.&#8221; (2.) The skipper has
a short rope which she turns over herself, while two other girls
turn a longer rope over her head.</p>

<p>The second class of games consists of those cases where the
skipping is accompanied by rhymes, and is used for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_202" id="PageII_202">[202]</a></span>
of foretelling the future destiny of the skipper. These rhymes

<h3><a name="GameII_150" id="GameII_150"></a>Skyte the Bob</h3>

<p>This game might be played by two, three, or more. A
small stone of a squarish form, called the &#8220;bob,&#8221; was placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_205" id="PageII_205">[205]</a></span>
on a level piece of ground. On this stone each player placed
an old button, for buttons were the stakes. A point was
fixed several yards from the stone, and a line was drawn.
Along this line, &#8220;the stance,&#8221; the players took their stand,
each holding in his hand a small flat stone named &#8220;the
pitcher.&#8221; This stone was thrown so as to strike &#8220;the bob&#8221;
and make the buttons fall on &#8220;the pitcher,&#8221; or nearer it than
&#8220;the bob.&#8221; The button or buttons that lay nearer &#8220;the
pitcher&#8221; than &#8220;the bob&#8221; fell to the lot of the player. The
second player did the same, but he had to guard against
driving any of the buttons nearer the first player&#8217;s stone. If
a button was nearer his stone than &#8220;the bob,&#8221; or the first
player&#8217;s stone, he claimed it. The third player followed the
same course if all the buttons had not been won by the two
players. If the buttons were not all won at the first throw,
the first player had a second chance, and so on till all the
buttons were won. If two played, if each won a button, they
alternately began, but if one gained the two buttons, the other
began. When three played, if one had two for his share he
played last in the following game, and the one that had nothing
played first. If the players, when three played, were experts,
the one whose lot it was to play second, who was called the
&#8220;poust,&#8221; lost heavily, and to be &#8220;pousted&#8221; was always looked
upon as a misfortune, for the reason that the first player often
by the first throw gained the whole stake, and then in the
following game the last player became the first, and the gainer
in the foregoing game became the last. If this player carried
off the whole stake, he in the next game took the last place,
and the last took the first, and so between the two good players
the &#8220;poust&#8221; had no chance.&#8212;Aberdeenshire (Rev. W. Gregor).&#8212;See
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_94">Buttons</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_151" id="GameII_151"></a>Smuggle the Gig</h3>

<p>Mr. Ballantyne describes the game as played in his young
days at Biggar as follows:&#8212;Two boys would each select his
own side. &#8220;First pick&#8221; was decided by lot. A third boy
took two straws, one shorter than the other, and held them
between his finger and thumb in such a way that only equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_206" id="PageII_206">[206]</a></span>
lengths were visible. Each leader drew a straw. The one
who drew the longest had &#8220;first pick&#8221; of all the intended
players, the other leader had the next; alternate choice was
then made by them until both sides were complete, and were
ranged by their leaders. Then lots were again drawn as to
which side should go out first. The side going out had to
show the Gig; anything easily carried in the hand sufficed.
The &#8220;outs&#8221; went out from the den twenty or thirty yards, sometimes
round the end of a house, to &#8220;smuggle the Gig&#8221;&#8212;that
is, to give one of their number the Gig to carry, care being
taken that the &#8220;ins&#8221; did not know who had it. During this
time the leader of the ins called &#8220;out&#8221; in a loud voice<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Zimerie, twaerie, hickeri seeven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aucherie, daucherie, ten and eleven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twall ran musha dan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tweedledum, twadledum, twenty-one. Time&#8217;s up!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Outs had all to appear by &#8220;Ready&#8221; when the chase began.
Boundary limits were fixed, beyond which outs could not run
and ins could not stand, within a fixed distance of the den.
This den was a place marked by a mark or rut in the ground,
about four feet by six feet. The outs endeavoured (particularly
the one carrying the Gig) to get into the den before any one
could catch and &#8220;crown&#8221; him. The pursued, when caught,
was held by the pursuer, his cap taken off, and the palm of
the hand was placed on the crown of his head. As he did so
the pursuer would say, &#8220;Deliver up the Gig.&#8221; If he had it
not, the pursuer went off after another player. If he had the
Gig, and succeeded in getting into the den without being
&#8220;crowned,&#8221; outs won the game; but if the Gig was caught
and &#8220;crowned,&#8221; ins won.</p>

<p>At Fraserburgh the players are divided equally. A spot is
marked off, called the Nestie. Any small object known to all
is chosen as the Gig. One half of the players receive the
Gig and retire, so as not to be seen distinctly by the other
half that remains in and near the Nestie. The Gig is concealed
on the person of one of the players that retire. When everything
is ready those having the Gig move towards the Nestie,
and those in the Nestie come to meet them. The aim is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_207" id="PageII_207">[207]</a></span>
catch the player who has the Gig before reaching the Nestie.
If this is done the same players again hide the Gig, but if the
Gig is discovered, the players discovering it now hide it.</p>

<p>At Old Aberdeen sides are chosen, then a small article (such
as a knife) is made the <i>gig</i>. Then one side, determined by a
toss, goes out and smuggles the gig and cries out, &#8220;Smuggle
the gig.&#8221; Then the other side rushes in and tries to catch the
one that has the &#8220;gig.&#8221; If the one that has the gig is free, the
same side goes out again.&#8212;Rev. W. Gregor.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_152" id="GameII_152"></a>Snail Creep</h3>

<p>In Mid-Cornwall, in the second week of June, at St. Roche,
and in one or two adjacent parishes, a curious dance is performed
at their annual &#8220;feasts.&#8221; It enjoys the rather undignified
name of &#8220;Snail Creep,&#8221; but would be more properly
called the &#8220;Serpent&#8217;s Coil.&#8221; The following is scarcely a perfect
description of it:&#8212;&#8220;The young people being all assembled in
a large meadow, the village band strikes up a simple but lively
air and marches forward, followed by the whole assemblage,
leading hand-in-hand (or more closely linked in case of engaged
couples), the whole keeping time to the tune with a lively step.
The band, or head of the serpent, keeps marching in an ever-narrowing
circle, whilst its train of dancing followers becomes
coiled around it in circle after circle. It is now that the most
interesting part of the dance commences, for the band, taking
a sharp turn about, begins to retrace the circle, still followed as
before, and a number of young men, with long leafy branches
in their hands as standards, direct this counter movement with
almost military precision.&#8221;&#8212;W. C. Wade (<i>Western Antiquary</i>,
April 1881).</p>

<p>A game similar to the above dance is often played by
Sunday school children in West Cornwall, at their out-of-door
summer treats, called by them &#8220;<a href="#GameII_101">Roll tobacco</a>.&#8221; They join
hands in one long line, the taller children at their head. The
first child stands still, whilst the others in ever-narrowing
circles dance around singing until they are coiled into a tight
mass. The outer coil then wheels sharply in a contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_208" id="PageII_208">[208]</a></span>
direction, followed by the remainder, retracing their steps.&#8212;Courtney&#8217;s
<i>Cornish Feasts and Folk-lore</i>, p. 39. A Scottish
game, &#8220;<a href="#GameII_111">Row Chow Tobacco</a>,&#8221; described by Jamieson, is played
in the same way, the boy at the extremity being called the
&#8220;Pin.&#8221; A clamorous noise succeeds the &#8220;winding up,&#8221; the
players crying out &#8220;Row Chow Tobacco&#8221; while giving and
receiving the fraternal hug. The words are pronounced
Rowity-chowity-bacco. The naming of this game in connection
with tobacco is curious. It is undoubtedly the same as
&#8220;Snail Creep.&#8221; I am inclined to think that all these games are
connected with an ancient form of Tree-worship, and that the
analogy of tobacco-rolling is quite modern.</p>

called the sow, into the large hole or kirk; while that of his
opponents, every one of whom keeps his shintie in one of the
smaller holes, is to frustrate his exertions by driving back the
sow. If he succeeds, either in knocking it into one of the
small holes, while one of his antagonists is in the act of
striking it back, he is released from the drudgery of being
driver. In the latter case, the person whose vacancy he has
occupied takes the servile station which he formerly held.&#8212;Lothian
(Jamieson). This is said to be the same game with
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_129">Church and Mice</a>&#8221; in Fife. Jamieson&#8217;s description is not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_210" id="PageII_210">[210]</a></span>
lucid. It appears that each player must hold his shintie with
its end in his hole, and it is only when he takes it out to prevent
the sow-driver getting his sow into or towards the kirk,
that the sow-driver has the chance of putting the sow into the
player&#8217;s hole, and so causing that player to take the place of
sow-driver.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_169" id="GameII_169"></a>Stacks</h3>

<p>A stack in the centre of the stackyard was selected, and round
a part of one side a rut was marked in the earth usually by the
toe-bit of the ploughman&#8217;s boot. This enclosure, not over
four feet wide at the broadest part, was called the den. One
of the players, selected to be the catcher, stood within this den,
and when all the players were ready turned his face to the
stack, and counted out loud the numerals from one to twenty,
the last with a great shout. During the count the players ran
round the stacks out of sight, but no hiding nor leaving the stackyard,
this was &#8220;not fair.&#8221; When twenty was heard one would
shout back &#8220;Ready!&#8221; Then out came the catcher. He was
not permitted to stand in or near the den, but went out among
the stacks and caught as many players as he could before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_212" id="PageII_212">[212]</a></span>
reached the den. The great aim of those &#8220;out&#8221; was to get
into the den unseen and untouched. If all the players got in,
then the catcher had to try again; but when all were caught
(which was seldom or never), the last one caught was catcher
for the next game. When one player was touched by the
catcher he or she had to remain in the den till the rest were all
in.&#8212;Biggar (Wm. Ballantyne).</p>

<p>Mr. Ballantyne says, &#8220;This game usually ended in a promiscuous
&#8216;catching&#8217; and &#8216;touching&#8217; game, each lad trying to catch
the lass he liked best, and some lads, for the fun of the thing,
would try and get a particular girl first, her wishes and will not
being considered in the matter; and it seemed to be an unwritten
law among them for the lass to &#8216;gang wi&#8217; the lad that
catched her first,&#8217; yet I have known lassies take this opportunity
to favour the lad they preferred. It was the correct thing for
the people to visit each other&#8217;s farms in rotation to play &#8216;the
stacks.&#8217;&#8221; This game was played when all the crops of grain
were in the stackyard under thack and rape (?nape). Then
it was customary for the servant lads and lasses of neighbours&#8217;
&#8220;ferm toons&#8221; to gather together and play at this game. Mr.
Ballantyne considers it was the third of three festivals formerly
held at the ingathering of the crops.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_170" id="GameII_170"></a>Stag</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; game. One boy issues forth and tries to &#8220;tig&#8221;
another, previously saying this nominy, or the first two lines<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>When one boy is tigged (or &#8220;tug&#8221;) the two issue forth hand in
hand, and when more, all hand in hand. The other players
have the privilege of breaking the chain, and if they succeed the
parties forming it are liable to be ridden back to the den. At
Lepton, where the game was publicly played, the boundaries
were &#8220;Billy tour end, Penny Haas end, and I&#8217; Horsin step.&#8221; So
played in 1810, and is still.&#8212;Easther&#8217;s <i>Almondbury Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>In the Sheffield district it is called &#8220;<a href="#GameII_84">Rag Stag</a>,&#8221; and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_213" id="PageII_213">[213]</a></span>
usually played in the playground, or yard, attached to a
school. Any number can play. A place is chalked out in a
corner or angle formed by the walls or hedges surrounding
the playground. This is called the den, and a boy stands
within the den. Sometimes the den is formed by chalking an
area out upon a footpath, as in the game of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_36">Bedlams</a>.&#8221; The
boy in the den walks or runs out, crying, &#8220;Rag-stag, jinny I
over, catching,&#8221; and having said this he attempts to catch one
of the boys in the playground who have agreed to play the
game. Having caught him he takes him back into the den.
When they have got into the den they run out hand-in-hand,
one of them crying, &#8220;Rag-stag, jinny I over, touching,&#8221; whilst
the other immediately afterwards calls out, &#8220;Rag-stag, jinny I
over, catching.&#8221; They must keep hold of each other&#8217;s hands,
and whilst doing so the one who cried out &#8220;Touching&#8221;
attempts to touch one of the boys in the playground, whilst
the one who cried &#8220;Catching&#8221; attempts to catch one of such
boys. If a boy is caught or touched, the two boys who came
out of the den, together with their prisoner, run back as quickly
as possible into the den, with their hands separated. If whilst
they are running back into the den any boy in the playground
can catch any one of the three who are running back, he jumps
on his back and rides as far as the den, but he must take care
not to ride too far, for when the boys who are already caught
enter the den they can seize their riders, and pull them into
the den. In this case the riders too are caught. The process
is repeated until all are caught.&#8212;Addy&#8217;s <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>Another name for the game is &#8220;Stag-out.&#8221; One player is
Stag, and has a place marked out for his bounds. He stands
inside, and then rushes out with his hands clasped together,
and endeavours to touch one of the other players, which being
accomplished, he has the privilege of riding on the boy&#8217;s back
to his bounds again.&#8212;<i>Book of Sports.</i> In a London version
the hands were held above the head, and joined by interlacing
the thumbs, the fingers being outspread, the boy had to touch
another while in this position.</p>

<p>In Shropshire it is called &#8220;Stag-warning.&#8221; One boy is
chosen Stag; he runs about the playground with his clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_214" id="PageII_214">[214]</a></span>
hands held palms together in front of him, trying to tick
(= touch) others. Each whom he touches joins hands with him,
and they run together in an ever-lengthening chain, sweeping
the playground from end to end, the boys at each end of the
chain &#8220;ticking&#8221; others with their disengaged hands, till all are
caught but one, who becomes the next &#8220;Stag.&#8221; The Stag gives
notice of his start by exclaiming<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The game is mentioned by Mr. Patterson in his <i>Antrim and
Down Glossary</i>. Northall&#8217;s <i>English Folk Rhymes</i>, p. 392, gives
a Warwickshire and Staffordshire version, in which the first
player &#8220;ticked&#8221; or &#8220;tagged&#8221; becomes Stag when the first game
is concluded, all having been caught. The words used are<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Halliwell (<i>Dictionary</i>) also describes the game, and indicates
its origin. The boy chosen for the game clasps his hands together,
and, holding them out, threatens his companions as
though pursuing them with horns, and a chase ensues in
which the Stag endeavours to strike one of them, who then
becomes Stag in his turn. Unfortunately, Halliwell does not,
in this instance, give his authority, but if it is taken from
the players themselves, it is a sufficient account of the origin
of the game, apart from the evidence of the name. All this
group of games is evidently to be traced to one original,
though in different places the detail of the game has developed
somewhat differently. It evidently comes down from the time
when stags were hunted not so much for sport as for food.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_172" id="GameII_172"></a>Steal the Pigs</h3>

<p>The game represents the stealing of a woman&#8217;s children and
the recovery of them. The mother, before beginning to wash,
disposes of her children in a safe place. She proceeds to do
her washing. While she is busy a child-snatcher comes and
takes away one. The others begin to cry. The mother hears
them crying. She goes and asks the reason of their crying,
and is told that a woman came and took away one of them.
She scolds and beats them all; tells them to be more careful for
the time to come, and returns to her washing. Again the children
cry, and the mother goes to see what is the matter with them,
and is told the same thing. She repeats her admonition and
bodily correction, and returns to her work. This process is repeated
till all the children are stolen. After finishing her washing,
she goes to her children and finds the last one gone. She sets
out in search of them, and meets a woman whom she questions
if she had seen her children. She denies all knowledge of them.
The mother persists, and at last discovers all her stolen children.
She demands them back. The stealer refuses, and puts them
behind her and stands on her defence. A tussel takes place.
The mother in the long run rescues her children.&#8212;Fraserburgh

<p>A schoolboys&#8217; game. Two boys pick a side, and there is one

who keep the den run after them to catch them. When one is
caught his capturer counts ten while he holds him (in a more
primitive but less refined state, spat over his head) and cries
<i>Stocks</i>. This prisoner is taken into the den. If they are all
caught the other side turns out. But if one of the outer side
can manage to run through the den and cry &#8220;Stocks,&#8221; all

stones in rotation; each hit a player gives all his side must
change stations, in some places going round to the left and in
others to the right. The stones are defended by the hand or a
stick, according as a ball or stick is lobbed. All the players
are out if the stone is hit, or the ball or stick caught, or one of
the players is hit while running. In different counties or
places these games are more or less modified.&#8212;Dublin, <i>Folk-lore
Journal</i>, ii. 264-265.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_217" id="PageII_217">[217]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kinahan, who describes this game, adds a very instructive
note, which is worth quoting:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;These games I have seen played over half a century ago,
with a lob-stick, but of later years with a ball, long before a
cricket club existed, in Trinity College, Dublin, and when the
game was quite unknown in a great part of Ireland. At the
same time, they may have been introduced by some of the
earlier settlers, and afterwards degenerated into the games
mentioned above; but I would be inclined to suspect that the
Irish are the primitive games, they having since been improved
into cricket. At the present day these games nearly everywhere
are succeeded by cricket, but often of a very primitive
form, the wickets being stones set on end, or a pillar of stones;
while the ball is often wooden, and very rudely formed.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_181" id="GameII_181"></a>Stool-ball</h3>

<p>The first mention of this game is by Smyth in his <i>Berkeley
Manuscripts</i>. In the reign of Elizabeth, the Earl of Leicester,
with an extraordinary number of attendants and multitudes
of country people, and &#8220;whom my neighbours parallel to
Bartholomew faire in London, came to Wotton, and thence to
Michaelwood Lodge, castinge down part of the pales, which
like a little park then enclosed the Lodge (for the gates were
too narrow to let in his Trayne), and thence went to Wotton
Hill, where hee plaid a match at stoball.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Gloucestershire
County Folk-lore</i>, p. 26.</p>

<p>The earliest description of the game, however, is by Aubrey.
He says &#8220;it is peculiar to North Wilts, North Gloucestershire,
and a little part of Somerset near Bath. They smite a ball,
stuffed very hard with quills and covered with soale leather, with
a staffe, commonly made of withy, about three feet and a half
long. Colerne down is the place so famous and so frequented
for stobball playing. The turfe is very fine and the rock (freestone)
is within an inch and a halfe of the surface which gives
the ball so quick a rebound. A stobball ball is of about four
inches diameter and as hard as a stone. I do not heare that
this game is used anywhere in England but in this part of
Wiltshire and Gloucestershire adjoining.&#8221; (Aubrey&#8217;s <i>Natural</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_218" id="PageII_218">[218]</a></span>
<i>History of Wiltshire</i>, p. 117; <i>Collections for North Wilts</i>,
p. 77). It is no doubt the same game as Stool-ball, which is
alluded to by Herrick in 1648 (<i>Hesperides</i>), and in Poor Robin&#8217;s
Almanack for 1677 (see Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>). D&#8217;Urfey&#8217;s
<i>Don Quixote</i>, written in 1694, alludes to it as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>It is described by Strutt in <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 103, as
a variety of game more commonly known as &#8220;goff&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_24">bandy
ball</a>,&#8221; the paganica of the Romans, who also stuffed their balls
with feathers. According to Dr. Johnson, the balls are driven
from stool to stool, hence the name.</p>

<p>In spite of Aubrey&#8217;s opinion as to the limited range of this
game, it appears to have been pretty generally played. Thus,
Roberts&#8217; <i>Cambrian Antiquities</i> says, &#8220;Stool-ball, resembling
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_163">cricket</a>, except that no bats are used and that a stool was
substituted for the wicket, was in my memory also a favourite
game on holydays, but it is now seldom or ever played. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_219" id="PageII_219">[219]</a></span>
generally began on Easter Eve&#8221; (p. 123). It was also an old
Sussex game. Mr. Parish&#8217;s account is that it was &#8220;similar
in many respects to <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_163">cricket</a>, played by females. It has lately
been revived in East Sussex by the establishment of stool-ball
clubs in many villages. The elevens go long distances to play
their matches; they practise regularly and frequently, display
such perfection of fielding and wicket-keeping as would put
most amateur cricketers to shame. The rules are printed and
implicitly obeyed.&#8221;&#8212;Parish&#8217;s <i>Dictionary of Sussex Dialect</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Edith Mendham says of the Sussex game, it is supposed
to derive its name from being played by milkmaids when they
returned from milking. Their stools were (I think) used as
wickets, and the rules were as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1. The wickets to be boards one foot square, mounted on a
stake, which, when fixed in the ground, must be four feet nine
inches from the ground.</p>

<p>2. The wickets to be sixteen yards apart, the bowling crease
to be eight yards from the wicket.</p>

<p>3. The bowler to stand with one foot behind the crease, and
in bowling must neither jerk nor throw the ball.</p>

<p>4. The ball to be of that kind known as &#8220;Best Tennis,&#8221; No. 3.</p>

<p>5. The bats to be of wood, and made the same size and
shape as battledores.</p>

<p>6. The striker to be out if the ball when bowled hits the
wicket, or if the ball be caught in the <i>hands</i> of any of the
opposing side, or if in running, preparing to run, or pretending
to run, the ball be thrown or touch the wicket before the striker
reaches it, and the ball in all cases must strike the face of the
wicket, and in running the striker must at each run strike the
wicket with her bat.</p>

<p>7. There should be eleven players on each side.</p>

<p>8. Overs to consist of eight balls.</p>

<p>Miss F. Hagden, in her short History of Alfriston, Sussex,
says, &#8220;In the Jubilee year the game of stool-ball was revived
and played in the Tye field. The rules resemble those of
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_163">cricket</a>, but the wickets are square boards on posts; the bowler
stands in the centre of the pitch, the bats used are round
boards with a handle. The game in Alfriston seems now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_220" id="PageII_220">[220]</a></span>
have died out again, but in many villages there are regular
clubs for the girls,&#8221; p. 43. It also appears to be a game among
Lancashire children to this day. A stool is used as a wicket,
at which it is attempted to throw the ball; a player stands near
the stool, and using his or her hand as a bat, wards off the
blow. If the ball hits the stool the thrower takes the place at
wicket; or if the ball is caught the catcher becomes the guardian
of the stool. Stool-ball, like all ball games, was usually played
at Easter for tansy cakes. Mr. Newell (<i>Games and Songs</i>)
says this game is recorded by the second governor of Massachusetts
as being played under date of the second Christmas
of the colony.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_184" id="GameII_184"></a>Stroke Bias</h3>

<p>Brome, in his <i>Travels over England</i>, 1700, p. 264, says:
&#8220;The Kentish men have a peculiar exercise, especially in the
eastern parts, which is nowhere else used in any other country,
I believe, but their own; it is called &#8216;Stroke Bias,&#8217; and the
manner of it is thus. In the summer time one or two parishes
convening make choice of twenty, and sometimes more, of the
best runners which they can cull out in their precincts, who
send a challenge to an equal number of racers within the
liberties of two other parishes, to meet them at a set day upon
some neighbouring plain; which challenge, if accepted, they
repair to the place appointed, whither also the county resort<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_221" id="PageII_221">[221]</a></span>
in great numbers to behold the match, when having stripped
themselves at the goal to their shirts and drawers, they begin
the course, every one bearing in his eye a particular man at
which he aims; but after several traverses and courses on both
sides, that side, whose legs are the nimblest to gain the first
seven strokes from their antagonists, carry the day and win the
prize. Nor is this game only appropriated to the men, but in
some places the maids have their set matches too, and are as
vigorous and active to obtain a victory.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_189" id="GameII_189"></a>Swinging</h3>

<p>Rhymes were said or sung by children and young people
when swinging. They were of the same character, and in many
instances the same as those given in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_133">See-saw</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#GameII_145">Shuttlefeather</a>,&#8221;
and were used formerly for purposes of divination.
The following extract, from the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> of Sept.
19th, 1895, seems to indicate an early notion connected with
swinging. It is taken from one of the articles in that paper
upon Jabez Balfour&#8217;s diary during his residence in the Argentine
Republic:&#8212;&#8220;On the 2nd November he (Balfour) mentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_223" id="PageII_223">[223]</a></span>
a curious Bolivian custom on All Souls&#8217; Day, when &#8216;they erect
high swings, and old and young swing all day long, in the
hope that while they swing they may approach the spirits of
their departed friends as they fly from Purgatory to Paradise.&#8217;
Two days later he adds: &#8216;I have to-day heard another explanation
of the Bolivian practice of swinging on All Souls&#8217; Day.
They swing as high as they can so as to reach the topmost
branches of the trees, and whenever they are thereby able to
pull off a branch they release a soul from Purgatory.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;<i>Notes
and Queries</i>, 8th series, vi. 345. With this may be compared
one of the methods and words used while swinging which I
remember playing, namely, that while swinging, either in a room
or garden, the object was to endeavour to touch either a beam
in the ceiling or the top branches of a tree, singing at the same
time a rhyme of which I only recollect this fragment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One to earth and one to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>this</i> to carry my soul to heaven.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last was said when the effort was made to touch the
ceiling or tree with the feet.&#8212;(A. B. Gomme.)</p>

<p>Miss Chase has sent me the following rhymes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The Deptford version is practically the same as known in

<p>When they came to the &#8220;heigh-ho&#8221; a more energetic push
than usual was given to the occupant of the swing, who was then
expected to vacate the swing and allow another child a turn.

there are no words used in rhymes or couplets.</p>

<p>One child stands in the centre of a ring, which is formed by
each member clasping the wrist of his or her left hand neighbour
with the left hand, thus leaving the right hand free. A
thimble is provided, and is held by one of the players in the
right hand. No circular movement is necessary, but as the tune
is sung, the right hand of each member is placed alternately in
that of their right and left hand neighbour, each performing the
action in a swinging style, as if they had to pass the ring on, and
in such a manner, that the one standing in the centre cannot
detect it. The thimble may be detained or passed on just as
the players think fit. The words are the following:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The thimble is going,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don&#8217;t know where.<br /></span>

<p>as the case may be, or rather may not be, in order to throw
the victim in the centre off the scent.&#8212;West Riding of Yorkshire
(Miss Bush).</p>

<p>The players sit in a row or circle, with their hands held palm<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_227" id="PageII_227">[227]</a></span>
to palm in their laps. The leader of the game takes a thimble,
and going to every member of the company in turn, pretends
to slip it between their fingers, or to hide it in their pinafores,
saying as she does so&#8212;&#8220;I bring you my lady&#8217;s thimble, you
must hold it fast, and very fast indeed.&#8221; Whereon each child
thus addressed should assume an air of triumph suitable to the
possession of such a treasure. After the whole party have
gone through the farce of receiving the thimble, the girl who
carried it round calls a player from the circle to discover who
holds it. For every wrong guess a fine must be paid. When
the searcher discovers the thimble she begins a new round of
the game by taking the place of leader; and so on, till the
accumulation of forfeits is sufficient to afford amusement in
&#8220;loosing the tines.&#8221; The game is called &#8220;Lady&#8217;s Thimble.&#8221;&#8212;Lincoln,

Peacock).</p>

<p>The rhyme used in the Sheffield game is that used in
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_80">Queen Anne</a>,&#8221; but it appears to have no relevance to this
game.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_195" id="GameII_195"></a>Thing done</h3>

<p>A game described by Ben Jonson in his play of <i>Cynthia&#8217;s
Revels</i> (act iv. scene 1). The passage is as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Phantaste.</span> Nay, we have another sport afore this, of
&#8216;A thing done, and who did it,&#8217; &amp;c.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Philantia.</span> Ay, good Phantaste, let&#8217;s have that: distribute
the places.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Phantaste.</span> Why, I imagine A thing done; Hedon
thinks who did it; Maria, with what it was done; Anaides,
where it was done; Argurion, when it was done; Amorphus,
for what cause was it done; you, Philantia, what followed
upon the doing of it; and this gentleman, who would have
done it better.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Gifford thinks that this sport was probably the diversion of
the age, and of the same stamp with our modern &#8220;Cross
Purposes,&#8221; &#8220;Questions,&#8221; and &#8220;Commands,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The children stand in two long rows, each holding the
hands of the opposite child, the two last forming an arch. They
sing the lines, and while doing so the other children run under
the raised arms. When all have passed under, the first two
hold up their hands, and so on again and again, each pair in
turn becoming the arch. Mrs. Lloyd (<a href="#NeedleHarpenden">Harpenden version</a>)
says the two first hold up a handkerchief, and the children all<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_230" id="PageII_230">[230]</a></span>
run under, beginning with the last couple. In the <a href="#NeedleLondon">London
version</a> (Miss Dendy) the &#8220;last line is called out in quite
different tones from the rest of the rhyme. It is reported to
have a most startling effect.&#8221; The <a href="#NeedleWarwickshire">Warwickshire version</a> is
played differently. The players, after passing under the
clasped hands, all circle or wind round one of their number,
who stands still.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) In some cases the verse, &#8220;How many miles to Babylon?&#8221;
is sung before the verses for &#8220;Thread the needle,&#8221; and the
reference made (<i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_317">ante</a></i>, vol. i., p. 238) to an old version seems
to suggest the origin of the game. This, at all events, goes far
to prove that the central idea of the game is not connected
with the sewing needle, but with an interesting dance movement,
which is called by analogy, Thread the needle. It is,
however, impossible to say whether the verses of this game are
the fragments of an older and more lengthy original, which
included both the words of &#8220;How many miles to Babylon&#8221;
and &#8220;Thread the needle,&#8221; or whether these two were independent
games, which have become joined; but, on the whole, I
am inclined to think that &#8220;Thread the needle,&#8221; at all events,
is an independent game, or the central idea of an independent
game, and one of some antiquity.</p>

<p>This game is well illustrated by custom. At Trowbridge, in
Wilts, a game, known as &#8220;Thread the needle,&#8221; used to be the
favourite sport with the lads and lasses on the evening of
Shrove Tuesday festival. The vocal accompaniment was
always the following:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shrove Tuesday, Shrove Tuesday, when Jack went to plough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother made pancakes, she didn&#8217;t know how;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She tipped them, she tossed them, she made them so black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She put so much pepper she poisoned poor Jack.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&#8212;<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 5th series, xi. p. 227.</p>

<p>At Bradford-on-Avon, as soon as the &#8220;pancake bell&#8221; rang
at eleven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the school children had holiday for the remainder
of the day, and when the factories closed for the night, at dusk
the boys and girls of the town would run through the streets
in long strings playing &#8220;Thread the needle,&#8221; and whooping
and hallooing their best as they ran, and so collecting all they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_231" id="PageII_231">[231]</a></span>
could together by seven or eight o&#8217;clock, when they would
adjourn to the churchyard, where the old sexton had opened
the churchyard gates for them; the children would then join
hands in a long line until they encompassed the church; they
then, with hands still joined, would walk round the church
three times; and when dismissed by the old sexton, would
return to their homes much pleased that they &#8220;Clipped the
Church,&#8221; and shouting similar lines to those said at Trowbridge.</p>

<p>At South Petherton, in South Somerset, sixty or seventy
years ago, it was the practice of the young folk of both sexes
to meet in or near the market-place, and there commence
&#8220;Threading the needle&#8221; through the streets, collecting numbers
as they went. When this method of recruiting ceased to add
to their ranks, they proceeded, still threading the needle, to the
church, which they tried to encircle with joined hands; and
then, whether successful or not, they returned to their respective
homes. Old people, who remember having taken part in
the game, say that it always commenced in the afternoon or
evening of Shrove Tuesday, &#8220;after having eaten of their pancakes.&#8221;
In <i>Leicestershire County Folk-lore</i>, p. 114, Mr. Billson
records that it was formerly the custom on Shrove Tuesday
for the lads and lasses to meet in the gallery of the Women&#8217;s
Ward in Trinity Hospital to play at &#8220;Thread the Needle&#8221; and
similar games.</p>

<p>At Evesham the custom is still more distinctly connected
with the game, as the following quotation shows:&#8212;&#8220;One custom
of the town is connected with a sport called &#8216;Thread my
needle,&#8217; a game played here by the children of the town
throughout the various streets at sunset upon Easter Monday,
and at no other period throughout the year. The players cry
while elevating their arms arch-wise<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Open the gates as high as the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let Victoria&#8217;s troops pass by.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&#8212;May&#8217;s <i>History of Evesham</i>, p. 319.</p>

<p>As all these customs occur in the early spring of the year,
there is reason to think that in this game we have a relic of
the oldest sacred dances, and it is at least a curious point that<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_232" id="PageII_232">[232]</a></span>
in two versions (Bocking and Ellesmere) the Anglo-Saxon
title of &#8220;Lady&#8221; is applied to the Queen.</p>

<p>The writer in <i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine</i>, who quotes the rhymes
as &#8220;immemorial,&#8221; says: &#8220;Another game played by a number
of children, with a hold of one another, or &#8216;tickle tails,&#8217; as it
is technically called in Scotland, is &#8216;<a href="#GameII_206">Through the needle-e&#8217;e</a>.&#8217;&#8221;
Moor (<i>Suffolk Words and Phrases</i>) mentions the game. Patterson
(<i>Antrim and Down Glossary</i>) gives it as &#8220;Thread the
needle and sew.&#8221; Barnes (<i>Dorset Glossary</i>) calls it &#8220;Dred the
wold woman&#8217;s needle,&#8221; in which two children join hands, and
the last leads the train under the lifted arms of the first two.
Holloway (<i>Dictionary of Provincialisms</i>) says the children form
a ring, holding each other&#8217;s hands; then one lets go and passes
under the arms of two who still join hands, and the others all
follow, holding either by each other&#8217;s hands or by a part of
their dress. &#8220;At Ellesmere,&#8221; Miss Burne says, &#8220;this game
was formerly called &#8216;Crew Duck.&#8217; It now only survives among
little girls, and is only played on a special day.&#8221; It is alluded
to in <i>Poor Robin&#8217;s Almanack</i> for 1738: &#8220;The summer quarter
follows spring as close as girls do one another when playing
at Thread my needle; they tread upon each other&#8217;s heels.&#8221;
Strutt calls this &#8220;Threading the Taylor&#8217;s needle.&#8221; Newell
(<i>Games of American Children</i>) gives some verses, and describes
it as played in America.</p>

&#8217;ee</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_197" id="GameII_197"></a>Three Days&#8217; Holidays</h3>

<p>Two players hold up their joined hands, the rest pass under
one by one, repeating, &#8220;Three days&#8217; holidays, three days&#8217;
holidays!&#8221; They pass under a second time, all repeating,
&#8220;Bumping day, bumping day!&#8221; when the two leaders strike
each player on the back in passing. The third time they say,
&#8220;Catch, catch, catch!&#8221; and the leaders catch the last in the
train between their arms. He has the choice of &#8220;strawberries
or grapes,&#8221; and is placed behind one of the leaders, according
to his answer. When all have been &#8220;caught,&#8221; the two parties
pull against each other.&#8212;Berrington (Burne&#8217;s <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>,
p. 522).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_233" id="PageII_233">[233]</a></span>&#8220;Holidays,&#8221; says Miss Burne, &#8220;anciently consisted of three

a week. See &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_176">Currants and Raisins</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="source">&#8212;Dorsetshire (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 223-224).</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Three children, generally boys, are chosen to represent
the three dukes. The rest of the players represent maidens.
The three dukes stand in line facing the maidens, who hold
hands, and also stand in line. Sufficient space is left between the
two lines to admit of each line in turn advancing and retiring.
The three dukes commence by singing the first verse, advancing
and retiring in line while doing so. The line of maidens
then advances singing the second verse. The alternate verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_249" id="PageII_249">[249]</a></span>
demanding and answering are thus sung. The maidens make
curtseys and look coquettishly at the dukes when singing the
fourth verse, and draw themselves up stiffly and indignantly
when singing the sixth, bending and bowing lowly at the
eighth. The dukes look contemptuously and criticisingly at
the girls while singing the fifth and seventh verses; at the
ninth or last verse they &#8220;name&#8221; one of the girls, who then
crosses over and joins hands with them. The game then continues
by all four singing &#8220;Here come four dukes a-riding,&#8221;
and goes on until all the maidens are ranged on the dukes&#8217;
side.</p>

<p>This method of playing obtains in most versions of the
game, though there are variations and additions in some
places. In the <a href="#DukesBocking">Bocking</a>, <a href="#DukesBarnes">Barnes</a>, <a href="#DukesDublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="#DukesHurstmonceux">Hurstmonceux</a>,
<a href="#DukesSettle">Settle</a>, <a href="#DukesSymondsbury">Symondsbury</a>, <a href="#DukesSporle">Sporle</a>, <a href="#DukesEHeaton">Earls Heaton</a>, and <a href="#DukesClapham">Clapham
versions</a>, where the verses begin with &#8220;Here comes one Duke
a-riding,&#8221; one boy stands facing the girls, and sings the first
verse advancing and retiring with a dancing step, or with a
step to imitate riding. In some instances the &#8220;three Dukes&#8221;
advance in this way. In the <a href="#DukesBarnes">Barnes version</a>, when the chosen
girl has walked over to the duke, he takes her hands and
dances round with her, while singing the tenth verse. In the
<a href="#DukesSymondsbury">Symondsbury (Dorset) version</a> the players stand in a group,
the duke standing opposite, and when singing the sixth verse,
advances to choose the girl. When there is only one player
left on the maidens&#8217; side the dukes all sing the seventh verse;
they then come forward and claim the last girl, and embrace
her as soon as they get her over to their side. In the
<a href="#DukesHurstmonceux">Hurstmonceux version</a>, when the girls are all on the dukes&#8217;
side, they sing the last verse. Miss Chase does not say
whether this is accompanied by dancing round, but it probably
would be. In the <a href="#DukesDublin">Dublin version</a>, after the third verse, the
duke tries to carry off the youngest girl, and her side try to
save her. In the <a href="#DukesWrotham">Wrotham version</a>, after the girls&#8217; retort,
&#8220;Quite as good, as you, sir,&#8221; the dukes select a girl, who
refuses to go to them: they then sing the last six lines when
the girl goes over. In the <a href="#DukesDorsetshire">second Dorset version</a> (which
appeared in the <i>Yarmouth Register</i>, Mass., 1874) the players<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_250" id="PageII_250">[250]</a></span>
consisted of a dozen boys standing in line in the usual way, and
a dozen girls on the opposite side facing them. The boys sing
the first two verses alternately; the girl at first refuses and then
consents to go. Dancing round probably accompanies this,
but there is no mention of it. In <a href="#DukesRoxton">Roxton, St. Neots</a>, after the
verses are sung, the duke and the selected girl clasp hands, and
he pulls her across to the opposite side, as in &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_445">Nuts in May</a>.&#8221;
In <a href="#DukesSettle">Settle</a> (Yorks.) the game is called &#8220;The Dukes of York
and Lancaster.&#8221; The first duke advances with a dancing step.
The game is then played in the usual way until all the players
are ranged on the dukes&#8217; side; then the two original dukes,
one of whom is &#8220;red&#8221; and the other &#8220;white,&#8221; join hands, and
the other players pass under their raised hands. The dukes
ask each of them, in a whisper, &#8220;red?&#8221; or &#8220;white?&#8221; The
player then goes behind the one he or she has chosen, clasping
the duke&#8217;s waist. When all the players have chosen, a tug-of-war
ensues between the two sides. In the <a href="#DukesEHeaton">Earls Heaton version</a>,
the duke sings the verses, offering gifts to the girl when
she has been selected. In the <a href="#DukesOxonWorcs">Oxfordshire version</a> (Miss
Broadwood) one player sings the words of the verse, and all
join in the refrain as chorus. In the <a href="#DukesMonton">Monton (Lancashire)
version</a> the duke sings the last verse, and then takes a girl
from the opposite side; and in another version from <a href="#DukesBarnes">Barnes</a>,
in which the words of the last verse are the same as these, one
of the dukes&#8217; side crosses over and fetches the girl. The duke
bows lowly before the chosen girl in the Liphook version before
she joins his side. In the <a href="#DukesEKirkby">East Kirkby, Lincolnshire, version</a>,
when the dukes sing the last verse, they advance towards the
opposite side, who, when they see the direction in which they
are coming, form two arches, by three of the players holding
up their arms, the dukes&#8217; side going through one arch and
returning through the other, bringing the chosen girl with
them. One Clapham version is played in a totally different
manner: the maidens form a circle instead of a line, and the
duke stands outside this until he is admitted at the line which
says, &#8220;let him in.&#8221; At the conclusion of the dialogue he breaks
in and carries one player off. This is an unusual form; I have
only met with one other instance of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_251" id="PageII_251">[251]</a></span>(<i>d.</i>) The action in many of these versions is described as very
spirited: coquetry, contempt, and annoyance being all expressed
in action as the words of the game demands. The dancing
movement of the boys in the first verse to imitate riding,
though belonging to the earlier forms, is, with the exception
of two or three versions, only retained in those which are
commenced by one player, partly, perhaps, because of the
difficulty three or more players experience in &#8220;riding&#8221; or
&#8220;prancing&#8221; while holding each other&#8217;s hands in line form.
I have seen the game played when the &#8220;prancing&#8221; of the
dukes (in a game where there were a dozen or more players
on each side at starting, as in the <a href="#DukesDorsetshire">Dorset version</a>) was as
important a feature as the maidens&#8217; actions in the other verses.
I think the oldest form of the game is that played by a fairly
equal number of players on each side, boys on one side and
girls on the other, rather than that of &#8220;one&#8221; or &#8220;three&#8221; players
on the dukes&#8217; side, and all the others opposite. The game
then began with the present words, &#8220;Here come three dukes;&#8221;
these three each chose a girl at the same time, and when these
three were wived, another three &#8220;dukes&#8221; would pair with
three more of the girls, and after that another three, and so
on. This form would account for the modern idea that the
number of dukes increases on every occasion that the verses
are sung, after the first wife has been taken over, and until
all the girls have been thus chosen. This idea is expressed in
some versions by the change of words: &#8220;Here&#8217;s a fourth [or
fifth, and so on] duke come a riding&#8221; to take a wife, the
chosen maiden becoming a duke as soon as she has passed
over on to the dukes&#8217; side. The process of innovation may be
traced by the methods of playing. Thus, in one version
played at Barnes (similar in other respects to <a href="#DukesBarnes">No. 10</a>), beginning
&#8220;three dukes a riding,&#8221; <i>three</i> girls were chosen by
the three first dukes, one by each, at the same time, and all
three girls walked across with the three dukes to the boys&#8217; line,
and stood next their respective partners. In two imperfect
versions I have obtained in <a href="#DukesRPark1">Regent&#8217;s Park, London</a>, the same
principle occurs. One girl began&#8212;&#8220;One duck comes a ridin&#8217;,&#8221;
and two girls from the opposite side walked across; the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_252" id="PageII_252">[252]</a></span>
&#8220;Five dukes come here a ridin&#8217;&#8221; was played by five players
on each side, and this was continued throughout. When the
verses were said, each of the five dukes took a player from
the opposite side and danced round with her. Again, in those
versions (<a href="#DukesSymondsbury">Symondsbury</a> and <a href="#DukesBarnes">Barnes</a>), where when one player
is left on the maidens&#8217; side without a partner, and all the dukes
are mated, the additional verse is sung, and this player is taken
over too. Beyond these versions are the large number beginning
with three or more children singing the formula of &#8220;three
dukes,&#8221; and choosing one girl at a time, until all are taken over
on to the dukes&#8217; side. Finally, there are the versions, more in
accord with modern ideas, which commence with one duke
coming for a wife, and continue by the girls taken over
counting as dukes, the formula changing into two dukes,
and so on.</p>

<p>If this correctly represents the line of decadence in this
game, those versions in which additional verses appear are, I
think, instances of the tacking on of verses from the &#8220;invitation
to the dance&#8221; or &#8220;May&#8221; games; particularly in the cases in
which the words &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got my bonny lass&#8221; appear. The
<a href="#DukesEHeaton">Earls Heaton version</a> is curious, in that it has several verses
which remind us of the old and practically obsolete &#8220;Keys of
Canterbury&#8221; (Halliwell, 96). It may well be that a remembered
fragment of that old ballad, which was probably once danced as
a dramatic round, has been tacked on to this game. The expression
&#8220;walk with me,&#8221; or &#8220;walk abroad with me,&#8221; is significant
of an engaged or betrothed couple. &#8220;I&#8217;m walking or
walking out with so and so&#8221; is still an expression used by
young men and young women to indicate an engagement.
&#8220;She did ought to be married now; she&#8217;ve walked wi&#8217; him
mor&#8217;n&#8217;er a year now.&#8221; Some of the versions show still more
marked signs of decadence. The altered wording, &#8220;Here
comes a Jew a riding,&#8221; &#8220;Here comes the Duke of Rideo,&#8221;
&#8220;A duck comes a ridin&#8217;,&#8221; and the Scotch &#8220;Campsie Dukes a
riding;&#8221; a Berkshire version, collected by Miss Thoyts (<i>Antiquary</i>,
xxvii. p. 195), similar to the <a href="#DukesMadeley">Shropshire game</a>, but
with a portion of the verse of &#8220;Milking Pails&#8221; added to it,
and the refrain of &#8220;Ransome, tansome, tismatee;&#8221; together<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_253" id="PageII_253">[253]</a></span>
with the disappearance of some of the verses, are all evidently
the results of the words being learnt orally, and imperfectly
understood, or not understood at all.</p>

<p>In this game, said in Lancashire to be the &#8220;oldest play
of all,&#8221; judging both by the words and method of playing, we
have, I believe, a distinct survival or remembrance of the
tribal marriage&#8212;marriage at a period when it was the custom
for men of a clan to seek wives from the girls of another clan,
both clans belonging to one tribe. The game is a purely
marriage game, and marriage in a matter-of-fact way. Young
men of a clan or village arrive at the abode of another clan
for the purpose of seeking wives, probably at a feast or fair
time. The maidens are apparently ready and expecting their
arrival. They are as willing to become wives as the dukes are
to become husbands. It is not marriage by force or capture,
though the triumphant carrying off of a wife appears in some
versions. It is exogamous marriage custom, after the tribe
had settled down and arranged their system of marriage in lieu
of a former more rude system of capture. The suggested
depreciation of the girls, and their saucy rejoinders, may be
looked upon as so much good-humoured chaff and banter
exchanged between the two parties to enhance each other&#8217;s
value, and to display their wit. While it does not follow that
the respective parties were complete strangers to one another,
these lines may indicate that each individual wished &#8220;to have
as good a look round as possible&#8221; before accepting the offer
made. It will be seen that there is no mention of &#8220;love&#8221; in
the game, nor is there any individual courtship between boy
and girl. The marriage formula does not appear, nor is there
any sign that a &#8220;ceremony&#8221; or &#8220;sanction&#8221; to conclude the
marriage was necessary, nor does kissing occur in the game.</p>

<p>There is evidence of the tribal marriage system in the
survivals of exogamy and marriage by capture occasionally
to be noted in traditional local custom. Thus the custom
recorded by Chambers (<i>Book of Days</i>, i. 722) of the East
Anglians (Suffolk), where whole parishes have intermarried
to such an extent that almost everybody is related to or connected
with everybody else, is distinctly a case in point, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_254" id="PageII_254">[254]</a></span>
intermarrying of &#8220;parishes&#8221; for a long series of years necessarily
resulting in close inter-relationship. One curious effect
of this is that no one is counted as a &#8220;relation&#8221; beyond first
cousins; for if &#8220;relationship&#8221; went further than that it might
&#8220;almost as well include the whole parish.&#8221; The old proverb
(also from East Anglia):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;To change the name, and not the letter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a change for the worse, and not for the better;&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that is, it is unlucky for a woman to marry a man whose
surname begins with the same letter as her own, also indicates
a survival of the necessity of marrying into another clan or
tribal family.</p>

<p>Another interesting point in the game is the refrain, &#8220;With
a rancy, tancy, tay,&#8221; which with variations accompanies all
versions, and separates this game from some otherwise akin
to it. There is little doubt that this refrain represents an old
tribal war cry, from which &#8220;slogans&#8221; or family &#8220;cries&#8221; were
derived. These cries were not only used in times of warfare,
tribes were assembled by them, each leader of a clan or party
having a distinguishing cry and blast of a horn peculiar to
himself, and the sounding of this particular blast or cry would
be recognised by men of the same party, who would go to each
other&#8217;s assistance if need were. The refrain is sung by all
the players in <a href="#DukesOxonWorcs">Oxfordshire</a> and <a href="#DukesMonton">Lancashire</a>, and in some versions
the players in this game put their hands to their mouths
as if imitating a blast from a horn, and a Lancashire version
(about 1820-1830), quoted by Miss Burne, has for the refrain,
&#8220;With a rancy, tancy, terry boys horn, with a rancy, tancy,
tee.&#8221; &#8220;The burden,&#8221; says Miss Burne, &#8220;evidently represented
a flourish of trumpets.&#8221; The <a href="#DukesBarnes">Barnes version</a>, &#8220;With a rancy,
tancy, terrimus hey!&#8221; and many others confirm this.</p>

<p>An interesting article by Dr. Karl Blind (<i>Antiquary</i>, ix.
63-72), on the Hawick riding song, &#8220;Teribus ye Teri Odin,&#8221;
points out that this slogan, which occurs in the &#8220;Hawick
Common-Riding Song,&#8221; a song used at the annual Riding of
the Marches of the Common, is an ancient Germanic war-cry.
Dr. Blind, quoting from a pamphlet, <i>Flodden Field and New
Version of the Common Riding Song</i>, says, &#8220;It is most likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_255" id="PageII_255">[255]</a></span>
that the inspiring strains of &#8216;Terribus&#8217; would be the marching
tune of our ancestors when on their way for Flodden Field and
other border battles, feuds, and frays. The words of the
common-riding song have been changed at various periods,
according to the taste and capacity of poets and minstrels, but
the refrain has remained little altered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The origin of the
ancient and, at one time, imperative ceremony of the common-riding
is lost in antiquity, and this old, no longer understood,
exclamation, &#8216;Teribus ye Teri Odin,&#8217; has (says Dr. Blind) all
through ages in the meanwhile clung to that ceremony.&#8221;</p>

<p>If we can fairly claim that the words of this game have
preserved an old slogan or tribal cry, an additional piece of
evidence is supplied to the suggestion that the game is a
reflection of the tribal marriage&#8212;a reflection preserved by
children of to-day by means of oral tradition from the children
of a thousand years ago or more, who played at games in
imitation of the serious and ordinary actions of their elders.<span class="addmark"><a href="#Add_24">[Addendum]</a></span> <span class="addmark"><a href="#Add_79">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>A group of lads and lasses being assembled round the fire,
two leave the party and consult apart as to the names of three
others, young men or girls, whom they designate Red Rose,
the Pink, and the Gilliflower. If lads are first pitched upon,
the two return to the fireside circle, and having selected a lass,
they say the above verse to her. The maiden must choose one
of the flowers named, on which she passes some approving
epithet, adding, at the same time, a disapproving rejection of
the other two; for instance, I will sink the Pink, swim the
Rose, and bring home the Gilliflower to land. The two young
men then disclose the names of the parties upon whom they
had fixed those appellations respectively, when of course it
may chance that she has slighted the person she is understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_256" id="PageII_256">[256]</a></span>

description of this game as played at Biggar when he was a

<h3><a name="GameII_200" id="GameII_200"></a>Three Holes</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo2271.png" alt="Three Holes" width="500" height="76" />
</div>

<p>Three holes were made in the ground by the players driving
the heels of their boots into the earth, and then pirouetting.
The game was played with the large marbles (about the size
of racket balls) known as &#8220;bouncers,&#8221; sometimes as &#8220;bucks.&#8221;
The first boy stood at &#8220;taw,&#8221; and bowled his marble along
the ground into 1. (It was bad form to make the holes too large;
they were then &#8220;wash-hand basins,&#8221; and made the game too
easy.) Taking the marble in his hand, and placing his foot
against 1, he bowled the marble into 2. He was now &#8220;going up
for his firsts.&#8221; Starting at 2, he bowled the marble into 3, and
had now &#8220;taken off his firsts,&#8221; and was &#8220;coming down for his
seconds.&#8221; He then bowled the marble back again into 2, and
afterwards into 1. He then &#8220;went up for his thirds,&#8221; bowling
the marble into 2, and afterwards into 3, and had then won the
game. When he won in this fashion, he was said to have
&#8220;taken off the game.&#8221; But he didn&#8217;t often do this. In going
up for his firsts, perhaps his marble, instead of going into 2,
stopped at A; then the second boy started from taw, and, having
sent his marble into 1, bowled at A; if he hit the marble, he
started for 2, from where his marble stopped; if he missed, or
didn&#8217;t gain the hole he was making for, or knocked his antagonist&#8217;s
marble into a hole, the first boy played again, hitting the
other marble, if it brought him nearer to the hole he was making
for, or else going on. In such a case as I have supposed, it
would be the player&#8217;s aim to knock A on to B, or some place
between 2 and 3, so as to enter 2, and then strike again so as
to near 3, enter 3, and strike on his way down for his seconds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_257" id="PageII_257">[257]</a></span>
and near 2 again. These were the chances of the game; but
if the boy who started went through the game without his
antagonist having a chance, he was said &#8220;to take off the
game.&#8221;&#8212;London (J. P. Emslie).</p>

to their side. The dialogue is generally spoken, not sung. The
boys turn their toes outwards to show their spurs. The number
of players on the girls&#8217; side is generally an uneven one, the
odd one is the mother and says the dialogue. This is
the most general way of playing, but there are interesting
variations. <a href="#KnightsChambers">Chambers</a> says two parties play, one representing
a dame and her daughters, the other the suitors. The suitors
move backwards and forwards with their arms entwined. The
mother offers her daughters when she says &#8220;Smell my lilies,&#8221;
and the game ends by some little childish trick, but unfortunately,
he does not describe this. Miss Ellis (<a href="#KnightsLeicester">Leicester</a>) says
if the number of players suited, probably all the boys, instead
of three, would be on one side and the girls on the other, but
there is no hard and fast line. They turn out their toes to
show their spurs: when they sing or say, &#8220;Pass through the
kitchen,&#8221; &amp;c., the girls stretch out their arms, still keeping
hold of hand, and the boys, forming a long tail, wind in and
out under their arms as they stand. Having previously
decided among themselves which girl they shall seize, they go
up and down the lines several times, until the period of suspense
and expectation is supposed to have lasted long enough.
Then the last boy in the line puts his arms round the chosen
girl&#8217;s waist and carries her off. This goes on until there is
only one girl left, who recommences the game on her part by
singing the first lines, choosing first a boy, who then becomes
a Spaniard. In the first version from <a href="#KnightsBelfast1">Belfast</a>, the first
girl who is asked to go refuses, and another is asked, who
consents. In the <a href="#KnightsColleyhurst">Manchester version</a> (Miss Dendy), the girl
refuses twice, then accepts. The &#8220;mother&#8221; is seated in state
with her &#8220;daughters&#8221; round her in the <a href="#KnightsBHeath">Bexley Heath</a> (Miss
Morris) version. The two &#8220;gentlemen&#8221; advance to her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_276" id="PageII_276">[276]</a></span>
turn haughtily away when refused. Then they choose a girl
and take her over to their side. In the Shropshire (Edgmond)
version, two girls, one from each end of the line of &#8220;daughters,&#8221;
goes over to the knights&#8217; side, who also &#8220;bow&#8221; and &#8220;bend&#8221;
when saying the lines, and the game is repeated saying five,
seven, &amp;c., knights. Here, also, the last player left on the girls&#8217;
side takes the knight&#8217;s part in the next game. Miss Burne
adds, at other places the knights call only one girl by name each
time. Both lines in the Shropshire game advance and retire.
In the <a href="#KnightsDublin">Dublin game</a> (Mrs. Lincoln), three young boys are
chosen for the suitors, one girl is the mother, and any number
from three to six personate the daughters. The first boy only
speaks the lines. At &#8220;Return, return, your coat is white,&#8221;
he, with the other two &#8220;suitors,&#8221; takes the girl, brings her
back, and says the last verse. They then sit down, and the
second suitor does the same thing, then the third one. Then
the game is begun again [with three other boys] until all the
daughters have been taken. In the <a href="#KnightsNandQ">version</a> quoted from <i>Notes
and Queries</i>, two children, mother and daughter, stand on one
side, the other players opposite to them, and advance and
retire. The contributor says they chant the words to a
pleasing old melody. The <a href="#KnightsYorks">Yorkshire version</a> (Miss E. Cadman)
is played in the usual way, both sides advancing and retiring
in turn, and at the end one of the &#8220;knights&#8221; tries to catch
one of the girls. They cross the room to each other&#8217;s places.
In Co. Down, at <a href="#KnightsBallymiscaw">Ballymiscaw</a>, Miss Patterson says one player
refuses when asked, and another consents, this one and the
&#8220;lord&#8221; then join hands and dance round together, saying the
last words. The <a href="#KnightsAnnaverna">Annaverna version</a> is sung by one on each
side&#8212;&#8220;king and the mother.&#8221; The <a href="#KnightsBerwickshire">Berwickshire game</a> was
played by six children, one on one side, five on the other.
The first lines are sung on both sides; then the rest is dialogue
until the girl refuses, when the &#8220;Jew&#8221; dances round by himself,
singing the words; she then consents, and the two dance
round with joined hands as in a reel, singing the last verse.
The dialogue is spoken with animation, and the &#8220;Jew steps
his foot&#8221; and prances away when saying these words. Twelve
children in the <a href="#KnightsPerth">Perth version</a> stand in a row, another stands a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_277" id="PageII_277">[277]</a></span>
little in advance, who is called &#8220;daughter Jane,&#8221; another is
the &#8220;mother.&#8221; Three more stand in front of the twelve and
are the &#8220;Dukes.&#8221; These dance forwards and backwards
before &#8220;Jane and her mother,&#8221; singing the first lines. The
mother answers. When they sing the last line the &#8220;Dukes&#8221;
choose one of the twelve, and sing the words over again until
all the twelve are on the &#8220;Dukes&#8217;&#8221; side. Then they try to
carry off &#8220;Jane&#8221; and the &#8220;mother,&#8221; and run until they are
caught. In the <a href="#KnightsClapham">Clapham school version</a> (Mrs. Herbertson), the
&#8220;Duke&#8221; tries to drag by force the chosen girl across a handkerchief
or other boundary, if successful she goes on his side.
In the <a href="#KnightsCornwall">Cornwall version</a> the &#8220;Dukes&#8221; retire and consult before
choosing a girl, then select one. When all have been taken
they bring them back in the same order to the &#8220;mother,&#8221; saying
the last verse, and the &#8220;mother&#8221; replies in the last two
lines. In the <a href="#KnightsLondon">London version</a>, the &#8220;Dukes&#8221; take the girl and
rob her, then bring her back. In the <a href="#KnightsFochabers">Fochabers version</a> (Rev.
W. Gregor), the two &#8220;sailors&#8221; join hands crosswise, walk
backwards and forwards, and sing the words. The girl crosses
over to them when chosen. When all are chosen the &#8220;sailors&#8221;
bring all the girls before the mother, singing the last verse.
The mother searches the daughters one after the other, finding
neither money nor ring. She then chases the sailors, and the
one caught becomes mother next game.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game has been said by previous collectors, and at
first sight may be thought to be merely a variant of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three
Dukes</a>,&#8221; but it will on investigation, I think, prove to be more
than this. In the first place, the obvious borrowing from the
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>&#8221; of a few words, as in versions Nos. <a href="#KnightsPerth">29</a>, <a href="#KnightsClapham">30</a>,
and <a href="#KnightsCornwall">31</a>, tells against the theory of identity of the two games.
Then the form of marriage custom is different, though it is
still marriage under primitive conditions of society. The
personal element, entirely absent from the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>,&#8221;
is here one of the principal characteristics. The marriage
is still one without previous courtship or love between two
individuals, but the parental element is present here, or at
any rate that of some authority, and a sanction is given, although
there is no trace of any actual ceremony. The young men, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_278" id="PageII_278">[278]</a></span>
suitors, apparently desire a particular person in marriage, and
although there is no wooing of that person a demand is made
for her. These suitors are, I think, making the demand on the
part of another rather than for themselves. They are the
ambassadors or friends of the would-be bridegrooms, and are
soliciting for a marriage in which purchase money or dowry
is to be paid. The mention of &#8220;gold and silver&#8221; in many
versions, and the line, &#8220;she must be sold,&#8221; is important.</p>

<p>All these indications of purchase refer to a time when the
custom of offering gold, money, or other valuables for a bride
was in vogue. While, therefore, the game has traces of carrying
off the bride, this carrying off is in strict accord with the
conditions prevalent when marriage by purchase had succeeded
to marriage by capture. The bargaining spirit is not much &#8220;en
evidence&#8221; in this game, not, that is to say, in the same sense
as is shown in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_205">Three Sailors</a>,&#8221; p. 282, but there is sufficient
evidence of a mercantile spirit to prove that women and girls
were too valuable to be parted with by their own tribe or family
without something deemed equivalent being given in return.
There is a desire shown to possess the girl for her beauty;
and that a choice of a suitor could or would be made is shown
by the remarks that she is too young and does not know the
language and customs of this suitor.</p>

<p>The mention of the spurs conveys the suggestion that the
suitors or ambassadors are men of quality and renown. To
win their spurs was an object greatly desired by all young
men. Their reply to the taunt that their spurs are &#8220;dull&#8221;
may mean that they are not bright from use, and may also show
the idea that these men have come on a journey from some
distance for a bride or brides, and this only is responsible for
their spurs not being as bright as usual. Again, being &#8220;richly
wrought&#8221; is probably an indication of wealth or consequence.
Mention must be made of the mead not being made nor the
cake yet baked, which occurs in two versions. If these two
versions can be considered old ones, this would tend to show
evidence of the ceremony of the eating together of particular
food, which forms the most important element in primitive
marriage ceremonies.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_279" id="PageII_279">[279]</a></p>

<p>There occurs in some versions the incident of asking the girl
to come, and the dancing round when she consents, mostly in
connection with the incident of invitation to dance. This may
not therefore belong, and I do not think it does, to the early
forms of this game; but we must remember that dancing formed
a part of the marriage ceremonies down to quite a late date, and
it is therefore not surprising it should be found in many versions.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that this game has for its origin an
historical event in the reign of Edward III., whose daughter
Jane married a prince of Spain. There is some possibility in
this, as doubtless the marriage was conducted by ambassadors
first of all with pomp and ceremonial, but I think the game
really dates from a much earlier period, and if there are any
grounds for connecting it with this particular royal marriage,
it may merely have altered and fixed some of the words, such
as &#8220;daughter Jane,&#8221; &#8220;Lords from Spain,&#8221; &#8220;Spanish gold,&#8221; in
people&#8217;s minds, and in this way tended to preserve the game
in its modern form.</p>

<p>Mr. Addy, in his <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>, considers that the mention
of the three knights and gifts of gold is a fragment of some
old pageant of the Three Kings of Cologne, who, according to
ancient legend, brought gifts to the infant Jesus, but I can see
no evidence of this.</p>

<p>It is somewhat curious that this game is very rarely sung to
a tune, nor have I succeeded in obtaining one. It is usually
said to a sort of sing-song chant, or else it is spoken in
dialogue, and that with a good deal of animation.</p>

<p>Mr. Newell gives versions, as played in America, similar to
many here given, and Mr. Northall (<i>Folk Rhymes</i>, p. 385) gives
one from Gloucestershire and Warwickshire.<span class="addmark"><a href="#Add_80">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In the <a href="#ShipsLondon">London version</a>, which I obtained from a maid-servant&#8212;two
lines of children stand, hand in hand, facing one
another. They advance and retire in line, with dancing steps,
alternately. The children sing the lines. When the last verse
is sung a girl from the end of each line advances, and the two
dance round together. This is continued until all have danced
in turn in the space between the lines.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) It will be seen that there is a probability of the <a href="#ShipsLondon">version</a> I
collected as a dance game and <a href="#ShipsRimbault">Rimbault&#8217;s nursery song</a> being
derived from the Christmas carol, a <a href="#ShipsBurne">variant</a> of which I reprint
from Miss Burne&#8217;s <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>. A version of this
carol from Kent is given in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3rd series, iii. 7.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_282" id="PageII_282">[282]</a></span>
Mr. A. H. Bullen, in <i>Carols and Poems</i>, gives an older version
of the same. In this version there is no mention of whistling,
singing, or playing the violin; but in the Kent version, the
third verse is the same as the fourth of that collected by
Miss Burne, and the dance collected by myself. In the <i>Revue
Celtique</i>, vol. iv., Mr. Fitzgerald considers this carol to have
been the original from which the pretty words and dance,
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_202">Duck Dance</a>,&#8221; were derived, see <i>ante</i>, vol. i. p. 113. If these
words and dance owe their origin to the carol, they may both
show connection with an older form, when the carol was
danced as a dramatic round.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The players form in two lines, and stand facing one another.
One line consists of a mother and daughters. The other of the
suitors. The mother stands a little in advance of her daughters.
They remain stationary during the game, the mother alone
singing the words on her side. The suitors advance and retire
in line while singing their verses. The mother turns partly
round when singing the two first lines of her verses addressing
her daughters, and then faces the suitors when singing to them
the remaining two lines. When she accepts the &#8220;kings&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_287" id="PageII_287">[287]</a></span>
brings one of her daughters forward, presents her to the
suitors, and shows them the money in her pocket, and the
ring on her finger. The daughter goes with the kings, who
take her a little way apart, pretend to rob her of her ring, money,
and clothes, and then bring her back to her mother, and sing the
last verse. They then run off in all directions, and the mother
and daughters chase and catch them, and they change sides.
Sometimes all the daughters are taken by the suitors before
they are robbed and brought back. The game is also played
by five players only; three representing the sailors or suitors,
and two the mother and daughter. The mother then chases
the suitors, and whoever she catches becomes the daughter
the next game. These are the usual methods of playing. In the
<a href="#SailorsSporle">Norfolk version</a> the middle one of the three suitors takes the
girl, robs her, and all three bring her back and sing the verses.
In the <a href="#SailorsMan">Isle of Man version</a> one player sits down, the others
join hands, advance and retire singing the lines. The girl who
is chosen joins the one sitting down.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This game points to that period of tribal society, when the
youths of one tribe sought to obtain their wives from the
maidens of another tribe according to the laws of exogamy, but
a definite person is here selected for the wife, and it is to the
relatives or persons having authority (as in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_202">Three Knights</a>&#8221;)
that the demand for the bride is made, and not to the girl
personally, as in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The game, while not so interesting a one to us as &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three
Dukes</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#GameII_202">Three Knights</a>,&#8221; has its particular or peculiar
features. It is probably later, and shows more clearly that
position and wealth were of importance to a man in the obtaining
of a wife. Individually he has not (apparently) courted
the girl before, but he comes for that purpose now. He may
be announcing himself under the various ranks or professions
mentioned, before stating his real position; or, this may show
that the girl having many suitors, and those of all degrees,
the &#8220;mother&#8221; or relatives are actuated by purely mercenary
motives, and wish to select the best and richest suitor for
her. We must remember that it was accounted great honour
to a girl to have many suitors and amongst these men distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_288" id="PageII_288">[288]</a></span>
by the performance of brave deeds, which had
gained them renown and pre-eminence, or wealth. The fact
that the rejection or acceptance of the suitors is made known
to the girl by the &#8220;mother,&#8221; or person having authority, shows
that &#8220;sanction&#8221; or permission is necessary, and that &#8220;rejection&#8221;
or &#8220;acceptance&#8221; is signified to the suitors in the words, you
&#8220;may not,&#8221; or, you &#8220;may&#8221; have a lodging here, signifies
admission into the family. This is a most interesting feature.
The girl is to &#8220;wake up,&#8221; that would be to rouse up, be merry,
dress in bridal array and prepare for the coming festival. She
is also given to the suitors with &#8220;in her pocket one hundred
pounds,&#8221; and &#8220;on her finger a gay gold ring.&#8221; This, it will be
seen, is given her by her &#8220;mother&#8221; or person having authority,
and probably refers to the property the girl brings with her to
her new abode for her proper maintenance there; the ring
shows likewise her station and degree in her former abode, and
is the token that she is fit bride for a king, and must be treated
accordingly. Curious, too, is &#8220;Here&#8217;s my daughter safe and
sound,&#8221; which looks like a warrant or guarantee of the girl&#8217;s
fitness to be a bride. The expression &#8220;walk with,&#8221; meaning
&#8220;to marry,&#8221; again occurs in this game as in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>.&#8221;
The line occurring in two versions, &#8220;And down by the door
they bend their knee,&#8221; is suggestive of courtesy shown to the
bride and her family at the threshold of the house.</p>

<p>The incident of the three kings becoming robbers is not
easily understood. Robbery was common of course, particularly
when money and valuables were known to be carried on the
person; but I do not think this is sufficient in itself to account
for the incident. It may be a reflection of the later fact that a
man always took possession of his wife&#8217;s personal property
after marriage, and considered it his own to do as he pleased
with. When this idea became codified in written law, the idea
might readily get reflected in the game, when <i>kings</i> would not
be understood as apparently taking things that did not belong
to them, unless they were bandits in disguise. This last verse
and the robbery may be a later addition to the game, when
robbery was of everyday occurrence. There may have been
(although there is nothing now in any version to warrant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_289" id="PageII_289">[289]</a></span>
idea) some similar action on the part of the kings, such as a
further arraying of the bride, and presenting her to their party
or house, which has been misunderstood. Mr. Newell suggests
that children having forgotten the original happy finish, and not
understanding the &#8220;haggling&#8221; over the suitors, turned the
kings into bandits. Children think it such a natural thing to
wish to marry kings, princes, and princesses, and are so sincere
in thinking it a matter of course to refuse a sailor or soldier for
a king, when it is only a question of marriage, and not of
choosing the one you like the best, that this reason does not to
me seem to apply to a game of this kind.</p>

<p>Two leaders each choose a name such as &#8220;Golden Apple&#8221;
and &#8220;Golden Pear.&#8221; The remaining children all hold each
other&#8217;s waists in a long string, the &#8220;Golden Apple&#8221; and
&#8220;Golden Pear&#8221; holding hands aloft like an arch. The string
of children then runs under the arch. The last child that
passes under is detained by the &#8220;Golden Apple&#8221; and &#8220;Golden
Pear&#8221; (they having dropped hands previously). The detained
child is asked in a whisper which she prefers, &#8220;Golden
Apple,&#8221; &#8220;Golden Pear;&#8221; she chooses, and then stands at the
back of the &#8220;Golden Apple&#8221; or &#8220;Golden Pear.&#8221; When all
the children have passed through, the &#8220;Golden Apple&#8221; and
&#8220;Golden Pear&#8221; hold each other&#8217;s hands and stand with the
others behind them and pull like a &#8220;Tug of War.&#8221; There
should be a line drawn between the &#8220;Golden Apple&#8221; and the
&#8220;Golden Pear,&#8221; and whichever side pulls the other over the
line, wins the game.&#8212;Northumberland (from a lady friend of

<p>Jamieson describes this game in the south of Scotland as
follows: &#8220;Two children form an arch with both hands. The
rest, who hold each other by the skirts following in a line,
attempt to pass under the arch. The first, who is called the
king, is sometimes laid hold of by those who form the arch,
each letting fall one of his arms like a portcullis for enclosing
the passenger. But more generally the king is suffered to pass,
the attempt being reserved for the last; whoever is seized is
called the prisoner. As soon as he is made captive he takes
the place of one of those who formed the arch, and who afterwards
stand by his side.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is differently played in Mearns, Aberdeen, and some other
counties. A number of boys stand with joined hands in a
semicircle, and the boy at one end of the link addresses the
boy at the other end of the line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Claret wine is gude and fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the needle-ee, boys.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The boy to whom this is addressed makes room between
himself and his next neighbour, as they raise and extend their
arms to allow the opposite boy to run through the opening
followed by all the other boys still linked to each other. If in
running through the link should be broken, the two boys who
are the cause suffer some punishment.&#8212;Ed. Jamieson&#8217;s Dictionary.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_207" id="GameII_207"></a>Thun&#8217;er Spell</h3>

<p>A thin lath of wood, about six inches long and three or four
inches broad, is taken and rounded at one end. A hole is bored
in that end, and in the hole is tied a piece of cord between two
and three yards long. It is then rapidly swung round, so as to
produce a buzzing sound. The more rapidly it is swung, the
louder is the noise. It was believed that the use of this instrument
during a thunder-storm saved one from being struck with
&#8220;the thun&#8217;er bolt.&#8221; I have used it with this intention (Keith).
In other places it is used merely to make a noise. It is commonly
deeply notched all round the edges to increase the
noise.</p>

<p>Some years ago a herd boy was observed making one in a
farm-kitchen (Udny). It was discovered that when he was
sent to bring the cows from the fields to the farmyard to be
milked, he used it to frighten them, and they ran frantically to
their stalls. The noise made the animals dread the bot-fly or
&#8220;cleg.&#8221; This torment makes them throw their tails up, and
rush with fury through the fields or to the byres to shelter themselves
from its attacks. A formula to effect the same purpose,
and which I have many and many a time used when herding,
was: Cock tail! cock tail! cock tail! Bizz-zz-zz! Bizz-zz-zz.&#8212;Keith
(Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>Dr. Gregor secured one of these that was in use in Pitsligo,
and sent it to the Pitt-Rivers Museum at Oxford, where it
now lies. Professor Haddon has made a collection of these
toys, and has written on their connection with the Australian
boomerang.</p>

<p>They are still occasionally to be met with in country districts,
but are used simply for the purpose of making a noise.</p>

<p>Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>, under &#8220;Tiggy Touchwood&#8221;) says,
&#8220;One player who is called Tiggy stands out, and each of the
others takes hold of or touches a piece of wood, such as a door,
or rail, &amp;c. One then leaves his &#8216;wood&#8217; and runs across the
playground, and if whilst doing so Tiggy can touch him he
must stand out or take Tiggy&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>One child is chosen to be &#8220;Ticky,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, to be on the <i>qui vive</i>
to lay hold of or touch any one who is not touching wood. If
played out of doors it must be clearly defined <i>what is wood</i>,
trees and all growing wood being forbidden. The fun consists
in the bold ventures of those who tempt &#8220;Ticky&#8221; to run after
them, and contrive to touch &#8220;wood&#8221; just before he touches
them. When one is caught he is &#8220;Ticky&#8221; in turn.&#8212;Swaffham,
Norfolk (Miss Matthews).</p>

<p>Played within a given boundary, in which were wooden
buildings or fences. When one of the players was being
pursued by the tigger, if he touched wood he could not be
made prisoner, but he was not allowed to remain long in that
position, and directly his hand left wood he was liable to
instant capture. If when pursued he called out &#8220;a barla!&#8221;
he was again exempt from capture, but he could not move from
the position or place where he or she was when they called
out, a barla! When wishing to move he had to call out &#8220;Ma
barla oot!&#8221; No den in this game, but constant running.&#8212;Biggar

<h3><a name="GameII_212" id="GameII_212"></a>Time.</h3>

<p>The players stand in a line. Two are chosen, who stand
apart, and fix on any hour, as one, two, three, &amp;c., or any
half-hour. A nestie is marked off at some distance from the
row of players. One of the two goes in front of the line of
players, and beginning at one end asks each the hour. This
is done till the hour fixed on between the two is guessed. The
one that makes the right guess runs to catch the other of the
two that fixed the hour, and she makes off to the &#8220;nestie.&#8221; If
she is caught she goes to the line of players, and the one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_294" id="PageII_294">[294]</a></span>
caught her takes her place. If she reaches the &#8220;nestie&#8221; without
being caught, she has still to run to the line of players;
if she does this without being caught she holds her place as
one of the time-fixers, but if caught she takes her stand in the
line, and the one that caught her becomes time-fixer.&#8212;Fraserburgh
(Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_213" id="GameII_213"></a>Tip it.</h3>

<p>This is played by six players, divided into two sides of three
each, with one captain to each side. A ring or other small
object is taken by the side which wins the toss, and then both
sides sit down to a small table. The in-side puts their hands
under the table, and the ring is given to one of the three players.
At a given signal they all bring up their closed hands on to
the table, and the other side has to guess in which closed fist
the ring is. The guesser has the privilege of ordering &#8220;off&#8221;
the hands which he thinks are empty. If he succeeds in
getting the empty hands off, he says &#8220;tip it&#8221; to the remaining
one. If he guesses right the ring changes sides. The game
is to keep the ring or other object on one side as long as possible.&#8212;London
(Alfred Nutt).<span class="addmark"><a href="#Add_19">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="GameII_214" id="GameII_214"></a>Tip-Cat.</h3>

<p>Strutt says this is so denominated from the piece of wood
called a cat, about six inches in length, and an inch and a half or
two inches in diameter, diminished from the middle to both ends.
When the cat is on the ground the player strikes it smartly, when
it rises with a rotatory motion high enough for him to hit it again
before it falls, in the same manner as a ball. He says there
are various methods of playing the game, and describes the
two following: A large ring is made in the ground; in the
middle of this the striker takes his station; his business then
is to hit the cat over the ring. If he fails in doing so he is
out, and another player takes his place; if successful, he judges
with his eye the distance the cat is driven from the centre of
the ring, and calls for a number at pleasure to be scored towards
his game: if the number demanded be found upon measurement
to exceed the same number of lengths of the bludgeon,
he is out; on the contrary, if it does not, he obtains his call.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_295" id="PageII_295">[295]</a></span>
The second way of playing is to make four, six, or eight holes
in the ground in a circular direction, and at equal distances
from each other, at every hole is placed a player with his
bludgeon: one of the opposite party who stand in the field
tosses the cat to the batsman who is nearest him, and every
time the cat is struck the players are obliged to change their
situations, and run once from one hole to another in succession;
if the cat be driven to any great distance they continue to run
in the same order, and claim a score towards their game every
time they quit one hole and run to another; but if the cat be
stopped by their opponents and thrown across between any
two of the holes before the player who has quitted one of them
can reach the other, he is out.</p>

<p>Mr. Kinahan says there is among old Irish games one sometimes
called cat, played with three or more players on each side,
two stones or holes as stations, and a lobber, but the regular
cat is played with a stick four inches long, bevelled at each end,
called the cat. This bevelled stick is laid on the ground, and
one end hit with a stick to make it rise in the air, when it is
hit by the player, who runs to a mark and back to his station.
The game is made by a number of runs; while the hitter is
out if he fails three times to hit the cat, or if he is hit by the
cat while running.&#8212;(<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, ii. 264.) The common
game of &#8220;tip-cat&#8221; was called <i>cat-and-kitten</i> by Dorset children.
The long stick represented the &#8220;cat&#8221; and the small pieces the
&#8220;kitten.&#8221;&#8212;(<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 234.) Elworthy (<i>West
Somerset Words</i>) calls it <a href="#GameII_178">Stick and Snell</a>. Brogden (<i>Provincial
Words, Lincolnshire</i>) gives it as tip-cat, as does Lowsley
(<i>Berkshire Glossary</i>), also <a href="#GameII_232">Trippit and Coit</a>, and Trippit and
Rack in some parts of the North.&#8212;Brockett&#8217;s <i>North Country

<h3><a name="GameII_219" id="GameII_219"></a>Tit-tat-toe.</h3>

<p>A game played by school children on slates. A round is
drawn, which is divided into as many divisions as is thought
necessary, sixteen being generally the least. These divisions
are each numbered, the centre containing a higher figure
than any in the divisions, usually 25, 50, or 100. Several
children can play. They each have a place or square allotted
to them on the slate in which to record the numbers they
obtain. A space is allotted to &#8220;Old Nick&#8221; or the &#8220;Old Man.&#8221;
The players alternately take a pencil in their right hand (holding
it point downwards on 1, and tapping on each number
with it), and shutting their eyes move round and round the
diagram saying<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Tit, tat, toe, my first go,<br /></span>

the last word is said. The player then opens his eyes, and
registers in his square the number at which the pencil stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_297" id="PageII_297">[297]</a></span>
This number is then scratched through on the diagram, to
signify that it is taken, the other players proceed in the same
manner as the first; then the first one begins again. This is
continued till all the numbers are scratched out, or till one of
the players puts his pencil into the centre, and thus wins the
game. If all the figures are taken before the centre is touched,
the game goes to the &#8220;Old man&#8221; or &#8220;Old Nick.&#8221; Also, if one
player puts his pencil in a division already taken, he records
nothing and loses that turn; this is also the case if, after the
verse is repeated, the pencil is found to be on a division or
boundary line or outside the round.&#8212;London (A. B. Gomme).</p>

</div>

<p>I was taught by a maid servant to play this game on the
ground. This girl drew the round and divisions and figures
on the gravel path or mould in the garden, and sharpened a
piece of stick at one end for the pointer. She did not know the
game as one played on slates, but always played it on the
ground in this way.</p>

<p>This game appears to indicate a lottery, and might originally
have had something to do with allotting pieces of land or other
property to prospective owners under the ancient common field<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_298" id="PageII_298">[298]</a></span>
system. The places when taken by one player not being available
for another, and the fact of it being known as played on
the ground, and not on slates, are both significant indications
of the suggested origin. The method of allotting lands by
lottery is described in Gomme&#8217;s <i>Village Community</i>. Mr.
Newell, <i>Games</i>, p. 140, records a similar game called &#8220;Wheel
of Fortune.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_222" id="GameII_222"></a>Tops</h3>

<p>The special games now played with tops are mentioned
under their respective titles, but the general allusions to the
ancient whipping-tops are important enough to note.</p>

<p>Strutt says the top was known with us as early at least as
the fourteenth century, when its form was the same as now,
and the manner of using it can admit of but little if any
difference. Representations of boys whipping tops occur in
the marginal paintings of the MSS. written at this period; and
in a work of the thirteenth century, &#8220;Le Miracle de Saint
Loys,&#8221; the whipping top (Sabot) is mentioned. The top was
probably in use as a toy long before. Strutt records the following
anecdote of Prince Henry, son of James I., which he met
with in a MS. at the Museum, the author of which speaks
of it as perfectly genuine. His words are&#8212;&#8220;The first tyme
that he, the prince, went to the towne of Sterling to meete
the king, seeing a little without the gate of the towne a stack
of corne in proportion not unlike to a topp wherewith he used
to play; he said to some that were with him, &#8216;Loe there is a
goodly topp;&#8217; whereupon one of them saying, &#8216;Why doe you
not play with it, then?&#8217; he answered, &#8216;Set you it up for me,
and I will play with it.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;<i>Sports</i>, p. 385.</p>

<p>Northbroke, in his Treatise against Dicing, 1579, p. 86,
says: &#8220;Cato giveth counsell to all youth, saying, &#8216;<i>Trocho</i> lude,
aleas fuge, <i>playe with the toppe</i>, and flee dice-playing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>In the English translation of Levinus Lemnius, 1658,
p. 369: &#8220;Young youth do merrily exercise themselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_300" id="PageII_300">[300]</a></span>
whipping-top, and to make it run swiftly about, that it cannot
be seen, and will deceive the sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cornelius Scriblerus, in his Instructions concerning the
Plays and Playthings to be used by his son Martin, says: &#8220;I
would not have Martin as yet to scourge a top, till I am better
informed whether the trochus which was recommended by Cato
be really our present top, or rather the hoop which the boys
drive with a stick.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Pope&#8217;s Works</i>, vi. 115.</p>

<p>Among well-known classical allusions may be noted the
following mention of whipping the top, in Persius&#8217;s third
Satire:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Neu quis callidior buxum torquere flagello.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus translated by Dryden:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">&#8220;The whirling top they whip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drive her giddy till she fall asleep.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus also in Virgil&#8217;s <i>&AElig;neid</i>, vii. 378:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Ceu quondam torto volitans sub verbere turbo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quem pueri magno in gyro vacua atria circum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intenti ludo exercent. Ille actus haben&acirc;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curvatis fertur spatiis: stupet inscia supra,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impubesque manus, mirata volubile buxum:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dant animos plag&aelig;.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus translated by Dryden:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;As young striplings whip the top for sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the smooth pavement of an empty court;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wooden engine whirls and flies about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admired with clamours of the beardless rout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lash aloud, each other they provoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lend their little souls at ev&#8217;ry stroke.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so Ovid, Trist. 1. iii. Eleg. 12:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Otia nunc istic: junctisque ex ordine ludis<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cedunt verbosi garrula bella fori.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Usus equi nunc est, levibus nunc luditur armis:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nunc pila, <i>nunc celeri volvitur orbe trochus</i>.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Passing from these general allusions to the top as a form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_301" id="PageII_301">[301]</a></span>
amusement, we enter on more significant ground when we take
into consideration the various passages in the early dramatists
and other writers (collected together in Nares&#8217; <i>Glossary</i>), which
show that tops were at one time owned by the parish or
village.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a coward and a coystril that will not drink to my
niece, till his brains turn like a parish-top.&#8221;&#8212;Shakespeare,

<p class="source">&#8212;Ben Jonson, <i>New Inn</i>, ii. 5.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">My life upon it, that a boy of twelve<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And make him dance before you.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&#8212;Beaumont and Fletcher, <i>Thierry and Theod.</i>, ii. 1.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;And dances like a town top, and reels and hobbles.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&#8212;Ibid., <i>Night Walker</i>, i. 1.</p>

<p>Every night I dream I am a town-top, and that I am whipt
up and down with the scourge stick of love.&#8212;&#8220;Grim, the
Collier of Croydon,&#8221; ap. <i>Dodsley</i>, xi. 206.</p>

<p>In the Fifteen Comforts of Marriage, p. 143, we read:
&#8220;Another tells &#8217;em of a project he has to make town tops
spin without an eel-skin, as if he bore malice to the school-boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Robin, in his Almanack for 1677, tells us, in the
Fanatick&#8217;s Chronology, it was then &#8220;1804 years since the first
invention of town-tops.&#8221;</p>

<p>These passages seem to refer to a custom of keeping tops by
a township or parish, and they are confirmed by Evelyn, who,
speaking of the uses of willow wood, among other things made
of it, mentions great &#8220;town-topps&#8221; (<i>Sylva</i>, xx. 29). The latest
writers who give positive information on the subject are Blackstone,
who, in his note on Shakespeare, asserts that to &#8220;sleep
like a town top&#8221; was proverbial, and Hazlitt, who, in his collection
of <i>English Proverbs</i>, has &#8220;like a parish-top.&#8221; (See also
Brand, ii. 448.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_302" id="PageII_302">[302]</a></span>Steevens, in his notes on Shakespeare, makes the positive
assertion that &#8220;this is one of the customs now laid aside: a
large top was formerly kept in every village, to be whipt in
frosty weather, that the peasants might be kept warm by
exercise, and out of mischief, while they could not work.&#8221;</p>

<p>This passage is repeated in Ellis&#8217;s edition of Brand, so that
there is only one authority for the two statements. The question
is whether Steevens was stating his own independent
knowledge, or whether he based his information upon the
passage in Shakespeare which he was illustrating. I think
there can be no doubt that the custom existed, in whatever
way we accept Steevens&#8217; statement, and the question is one of
considerable interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tops&#8221; is one of those games which are strictly limited
to particular seasons of the year, and any infringement of
those seasons is strictly tabooed by the boys. Hone (<i>Every
Day Book</i>, i. 127), records the following rhyme:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tops are in, spin &#8217;em agin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tops are out, smuggin&#8217; about,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but does not mention the season. It is, however, the early
spring. This rhyme is still in use, and may occasionally be
heard in the streets of London in the top season. Smugging
is legitimate stealing when boys play out of season. &#8220;Marbles
furst, then comes tops, then comes kites and hoops,&#8221; said a
London boy who had acquired some tops by &#8220;smuggin;&#8221; but
these rules are fast becoming obsolete, as is also the use of a
dried eel skin as the favourite whip or thong used.</p>

<p>The keeping of a top by the parish in its corporate capacity
is not likely to have arisen for the sake of supplying people
with amusement, and we must look to a far more ancient
origin for this singular custom. Hone mentions a doubtful
story of a top being used in the ritual of one of the churches
at Paris. (The burial of Alleluia. The top was whipped by
a choir-boy from one end of the choir to the other: <i>Every Day
Book</i>, i. 100), and if this can be confirmed it would be a link in
the chain of evidence. But the whole subject requires much
more evidence than it is now possible to go into here, though
even, as far as we can now go, I am tempted to suggest that<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_303" id="PageII_303">[303]</a></span>
this well-known toy takes us back to the serious rites of ancient
religions.</p>

<p>Brady&#8217;s <i>Clavis Calendaria</i>, i. 209, mentions the discontinued
custom of whipping tops on Shrove Tuesday as originating in
the Popish Carnival as types of the rigour of Church discipline.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the tee-totum is the earliest form
of top, and as its use is for gambling, it is probable that this
and the top were formerly used for purposes of divination.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_223" id="GameII_223"></a>The Totum, or Tee-to-tum</h3>

<p>The Totum is really only a top to spin by hand. It is made
of a square piece of wood or bone, the four sides being each
marked with a letter, and the peg is put through a hole in the
centre. Sometimes the totum is shaped to a point on the
under side, and a pin fixed in the upper part, by which it is
twirled round.</p>

<p>The game played is one of chance; it may be played by two
or more, either boys or girls, and is played only at Christmas.
In Keith the letters are A, N, D, T. In playing the stake is one
pin, and each plays in turn. If the side with A on it falls uppermost
the player wins the whole stake&#8212;&#8220;A, tack a&#8217;.&#8221; If N
turns up the player gets nothing&#8212;&#8220;N, nikil (nihil), nothing.&#8221;
If T turns up one pin falls to the player&#8212;&#8220;T, tack ane.&#8221; If D
comes uppermost the player has to lay down a pin&#8212;&#8220;D, dossie
doon.&#8221; At times the game was played by paying a stake to
all the letters except A, and the words used were&#8212;&#8220;D, dip
it,&#8221; &#8220;T, tip it,&#8221; and &#8220;N, nip it.&#8221;&#8212;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>We played the game when children usually at Christmas time.
The players sat round a table. A pool was made, each player
putting in the same amount of stakes, either pins, counters,
nuts, or money. One player collected the pool and then spun
the tee-totum by his fingers. Whichever letter was uppermost
when it stopped, the player had to obey.</p>

<p>T, was take all (the contents of the pool).</p>

<p>H, half the contents.</p>

<p>N, nothing.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_304" id="PageII_304">[304]</a></p>

<p>P, to put into the pool the same amount as the stakes were
at first.</p>

<p>When this was done the next player spun the totum in his
turn. When one player got T a fresh pool had to be collected.&#8212;London
(A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>Jamieson&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i> says children lay up stores of pins
to play at this game at Christmas time.</p>

<p>William Dunbar, the Scottish poet (James IV.), seems to refer
to this game in the poem, <i>Schir, &#541;it remembir as of befoir</i>, in
the words<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<span class="i0">&#8220;He playis with <i>totum</i>, and I with <i>nichell</i>&#8221; (l. 74).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Strutt (<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, page 385) says the four sides
were marked with letters, and describes the game as we now
play it in London.</p>

<p>All tee-totums or whirligigs seem to have some reference to
tops, except that the tee-totum is used principally for gambling.</p>

<p>Some have numbers on their sides like dice instead of
letters, and some are of octagonal shape.</p>

<p>The Tower is formed by a circle of children, two of whom
constitute the gate. These two join hands, and raise or lower
their arm to open or shut the gate. The Tower is summoned
to open its gates to admit &#8220;King George and all his merry
men,&#8221; how represented I can&#8217;t remember; but I know that at

<p>A girl is placed in the middle of a ring and says the lines, the
names being altered to suit the players. She points to each one
named, and at the last line the one selected immediately runs
away; if the girl catches him he pays a forfeit, or the game is
commenced again, the boy being placed in the middle.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_227" id="GameII_227"></a>Trades</h3>

<p>Sides are chosen. These stand apart from each other,
inside the line of their den. One side chooses amongst themselves
a trade, and then walk over to the other side, imitating
the actions pertaining to different parts of that trade, and giving
the initial letter. If the trade is guessed by the opposite side,
that side chooses the next trade, and performs the actions. If
the trade is not guessed, the side is at liberty to choose another,
and continue until one is guessed.&#8212;Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire
(Miss Matthews).</p>

<p>The players that are to act the dumb tradesmen agree among
themselves what trades are to be imitated. When this point
is settled they present themselves before those that are to guess
the trade, and proclaim three poor tradesmen wanting a trade&#8212;dumb.
They then begin the work of imitation. The onlooker
that first discovers the trade calls it out, and he becomes
the dumb tradesman during the next round.&#8212;Fraserburgh (Rev.
W. Gregor).</p>

<p>Two boys privately arrange that the pass-word shall be some
implement of a particular trade. The trade is announced after
the above dialogue, and carpenters, nailors, sailors, smiths,
tinkers, or any other is answered; and on guessing the instrument,
&#8220;Plane him,&#8221; &#8220;Hammer him,&#8221; &#8220;Rasp him,&#8221; or
&#8220;Solder him,&#8221; is called out; then the fun is that the unfortunate
wight who guesses the &#8220;tool&#8221; is beaten with the caps
of his fellows till he reaches a fixed goal, after which he
goes out in turn.&#8212;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, cccxvi. In his
<i>Dictionary</i> it is called &#8220;Trades, and Dumb Motions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Northall (<i>English Folk-Rhymes</i>) records this game as being
played in Warwickshire. The method is practically the same
as the Forest of Dean, except that the &#8220;tradesmen&#8221; are beaten
if their trade is easily guessed by the others. They may also
be beaten if they show their teeth during the operations.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_228" id="GameII_228"></a>Trap, Bat, and Ball</h3>

<p>A game played with a trap, a ball, and a small bat. The
trap is of wood made like a slipper, with a hollow at the heel
end for the ball, and a kind of wooden spoon moving on a
pivot, in the bowl of which the ball is placed. Two sides
play&#8212;one side bats, the other fields. One of the batsmen
strikes the end or handle of the spoon, the ball then rises into
the air, and the art of the game is for the batsman to strike it
as far as possible with the bat before it reaches the ground.
The other side who are &#8220;fielding,&#8221; try either to catch the
ball before it falls to the ground, or to bowl it from where it
falls to hit the trap. If they succeed in catching the ball all
the &#8220;ins&#8221; are out, and their side goes in to strike the ball,
and the previous batsmen to field; if the trap is hit the batsman
is out and another player of his side takes his place. The
batsman is also out if he allows the ball to touch the trap
when in the act of hitting it.&#8212;(A. B. Gomme.)</p>

<p>Halliwell (<i>Dictionary</i>) says, &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_444">Nurspell</a>&#8221; in Lincolnshire is
somewhat similar to &#8220;Trap Ball.&#8221; It is played with a kibble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_307" id="PageII_307">[307]</a></span>
a nur and a spell. By striking the end of the spell with the
kibble the nur rises into the air, and the game is to strike it
with the kibble before it reaches the ground. He who drives
it the greatest distance is the winner. Miss Burne (<i>Shropshire
Folk-lore</i>, p. 527) says, &#8220;Trib and Knurr,&#8221; otherwise
&#8220;Dog Stick,&#8221; are local names for &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_444">Knur and Spell</a>,&#8221; a superior
form of &#8220;Trap Ball.&#8221; The &#8220;knurr&#8221; is a hard wooden ball,
the &#8220;trib&#8221; is the trap or receptacle, the &#8220;Dog Stick&#8221; the
sort of club with which it is struck. The game is played as
described by Halliwell. She adds it was formerly the favourite
pastime of young men on Shrove Tuesday.</p>

<p>At Bury St. Edmonds, on Shrove Tuesday, Easter Monday,
and Whitsuntide festivals, twelve old women side off for a
game at &#8220;Trap and Ball,&#8221; which is kept up with the greatest
spirit and vigour until sunset.&#8212;<i>Suffolk County Folk-lore</i>, p. 56.

seek a new station. If the catch-pole can get in before the
person who changes his station, he has the right to take his
place, and the other becomes pursuer.&#8212;Jamieson.</p>

a little elevated at the other, which is struck with a buckstick.

<p>A game played by two persons, with bandies or sticks

each end of the ground occupied a line is drawn. He who<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_309" id="PageII_309">[309]</a></span>
strikes off the nacket from the one line, tries to drive it as near
the other as possible. The antagonist who stands between
him and the goal tries to throw back with his hand the nacket
to the line from which the other has struck it. If he does this
he takes the place of the other. If not, the distance is measured
between the striking point and the nacket with one of the
sticks used in striking, and for every length of the stick one is
counted against the caster.&#8212;(Angus) Jamieson. The editor of
Jamieson adds that the name must have been originally the
same as the English <a href="#GameII_228">Trap</a>, although in this game a ball is used

owe its origin to the medi&aelig;val mazes or labyrinths called &#8220;Troy
Towns,&#8221; or &#8220;Troy Walls,&#8221; many of which existed in different
parts of England and Wales. It appears that games connected
with the midsummer festivals were held in these labyrinths.
This may, perhaps, account for the origin of this puzzle being
considered a game. For accounts of labyrinths or mazes called
&#8220;Troy Towns,&#8221; see <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 1st series, xi. 132, 193;

<p>This is acted by two or more girls who walk or dance up
and down, turning, when they say &#8220;Turn, cheeses, turn.&#8221;&#8212;Halliwell.</p>

<p>I remember playing this game, but my remembrance is very
imperfect. As far as I remember, there were two lines or rows
of children. They danced forwards and backwards, crossing to
the opposite side, and turning round. At the words, &#8220;Turn,
cheeses, turn,&#8221; the cheeses all turned round rapidly and then
sank on the ground. The players tried to inflate their dresses as
much as possible, and then stooped down to the ground, so that
the dress remained inflated; only the head and shoulders surrounded
by a ball-like skirt then appeared, intended to represent
a cheese. All joined hands and danced round at the end.
The lines sang were the same as the <a href="#CheeseLeicester">Leicester</a> except the
third, which was&#8212;&#8220;Some a penny, some a groat, turn, cheeses,
turn.&#8221; It was necessary for skirts to be very &#8220;full&#8221; to make
good cheeses&#8212;as wide at the waist as at the bottom of the
skirt.&#8212;(A. B. Gomme.)</p>

<p>Holland (<i>Cheshire Glossary</i>) says, a frequent amusement of
girls is making cheeses. They turn round and round till their
dresses fly out at the bottom; then suddenly squatting down,
the air confined under the dress causes the skirt to bulge out
like a balloon. When skilfully done the appearance is that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_312" id="PageII_312">[312]</a></span>
a girl&#8217;s head and shoulders peeping out of an immense cushion.
Evans&#8217; <i>Leicestershire Glossary</i> mentions this game. He says,
&#8220;The performers sing a song of which the refrain is &#8216;Turn,
cheeses, turn,&#8217; but I do not remember to have heard the
example cited by Mr. Halliwell-Phillips.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Percy Soc.</i>, iv.
p. 122.</p>

<p>I always understood that the green cheeses were sage
cheeses&#8212;cheeses containing sage. Halliwell says, &#8220;Green
cheeses, I am informed, are made with sage and potato tops.
Two girls are said to be &#8216;cheese and cheese.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_247" id="GameII_247"></a>Turn the Trencher, or, My Lady&#8217;s Toilet</h3>

<p>An indoor game played at Christmas time by children and
adults. All the players in the room must be seated. They
are then asked by the leader of the game to choose some
article of a lady&#8217;s toilet, which article they will personally
represent, such as diamond ring, bracelet, comb, brush, jug,
basin, powder, hair-dye, dress, mantle, &amp;c.&#8212;any article, in
fact, belonging to the toilet.</p>

<p>The leader then goes to the centre of the room with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_313" id="PageII_313">[313]</a></span>
small trencher, round card tray, plate, or saucer in her hand.
She spins this (the trencher) round as quickly as possible,
saying, &#8220;My lady&#8217;s going out and needs her &#8216;dress,&#8217;&#8221; or
any other article she chooses to name. The player who
has taken the name of &#8220;dress&#8221; must get up from her seat
and catch the trencher before it falls. If successful this player
then spins the trencher, calling out the name of another article
of the toilet. If the player fails to catch it, a forfeit is demanded
by the leader. Occasionally the spinner will say, &#8220;My lady&#8217;s
going to a ball (or elsewhere), and needs the whole of her
toilet.&#8221; When this is said, every player has to get up and
take another place before the trencher falls; the last one to
get a place has to take the trencher, and if it is down, to pay
a forfeit. At the end of the game the forfeits are &#8220;cried&#8221; in
the usual way.&#8212;(A. B. Gomme.)</p>

<p>This (called &#8220;Truckle the Trencher&#8221;) used to be a standard
game for winter evenings. A circle was formed, and each one
was seated on the floor, every player taking the name of a flower.
This game was entered into with the greatest vivacity by staid
and portly individuals as well as by their juniors.&#8212;Dorsetshire
(<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 238).</p>

<p>A trencher, saucer, or plate is used. The players sit in a
circle, and one twirls the trencher, at the same time calling
out the name of one of the players. He or she jumps up and
tries to catch the whirling trencher before it falls. If it falls or
is knocked over, a forfeit is lodged, and the player who lodged
the forfeit now becomes the twirler. If the trencher is caught,
it is handed back and twirled again, and another name called
out. The game continues till all or, at least, most of the
players have lodged forfeits. It is called &#8220;Turn the Plettie.&#8221;&#8212;Macduff
(Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>This game is played in the same way in Ireland. It is called
&#8220;Twirl the Trencher,&#8221; and the players take names of towns or
beasts.&#8212;(Miss Keane.)</p>

<p>Brogden (<i>Provincial Words, Lincolnshire</i>) and Halliwell
(<i>Dictionary</i>) mention it as &#8220;Turn Trencher,&#8221; a game played
at Christmas time. Moor (<i>Suffolk Words and Phrases</i>) calls
it &#8220;Move all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut-ball,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor2_12" id="FNanchor2_12"></a><a href="#Footnote2_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as played at a young ladies&#8217; school at Shiffnal
fifty years ago. The players stood together in their &#8220;den,&#8221;
behind a line marked on the ground, all except one, who was
&#8220;out,&#8221; and who stood at a distance and threw the ball to them.
One of the players in the den then hit back the ball with the
palm of the hand, and immediately ran to one of three brickbats,
called &#8220;tuts,&#8221; which were set up at equal distances on the
ground, in such positions that a player running past them all
would describe a complete circle by the time she returned to
the den. The player who was &#8220;out&#8221; tried to catch the ball,
and to hit the runner with it while passing from one &#8220;tut&#8221; to
another. If she succeeded in doing so, she took her place in
the den, and the other went &#8220;out&#8221; in her stead. This game
is very nearly identical with &#8220;rounders.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>,
p. 524.</p>

<p>A game at ball, now only played by boys, but half a century
ago by adults on Ash Wednesday, believing that unless they
did so they would fall sick in harvest time. This is a very
ancient game, and was elsewhere called &#8220;<a href="#GameII_181">Stool-ball</a>,&#8221; indulged
in by the clergy as well as laity to avert misfortune.&#8212;Ross and
Stead&#8217;s <i>Holderness Glossary</i>. The game is not described.</p>

<p>Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) says this game is the same as
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_45">Pize-ball</a>.&#8221; Halliwell (<i>Dictionary</i>) says it is a sort of &#8220;Stob-ball
Play.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) &#8220;The Twelve Days&#8221; was a Christmas game. It was
a customary thing in a friend&#8217;s house to play &#8220;The Twelve
Days,&#8221; or &#8220;My Lady&#8217;s Lap Dog,&#8221; every Twelfth Day night.
The party was usually a mixed gathering of juveniles and
adults, mostly relatives, and before supper&#8212;that is, before
eating mince pies and twelfth cake&#8212;this game and the cushion
dance were played, and the forfeits consequent upon them
always cried. The company were all seated round the room.
The leader of the game commenced by saying the first line.
Generally the version used was similar to <a href="#ChristmasI">No. I.</a> In later
years the shorter version, <a href="#ChristmasIII">No. III.</a>, was said. The lines
for the &#8220;first day&#8221; of Christmas was said by each of the
company in turn; then the first &#8220;day&#8221; was repeated, with
the addition of the &#8220;second&#8221; by the leader, and then this
was said all round the circle in turn. This was continued
until the lines for the &#8220;twelve days&#8221; were said by every
player. For every mistake a forfeit&#8212;a small article belonging
to the person&#8212;had to be given up. These forfeits were
afterwards &#8220;cried&#8221; in the usual way, and were not returned
to the owner until they had been redeemed by the penalty
inflicted being performed.</p>

<p>In version <a href="#ChristmasIV">No. IV.</a>, the game began by the leader saying
to the player sitting next to her, &#8220;Take this!&#8221; holding the
hands as if giving something. The neighbour answered,
&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; The leader answered, &#8220;A gaping, wide-mouthed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_320" id="PageII_320">[320]</a></span>
waddling frog.&#8221; The second player then turned to
the third and repeated, &#8220;A gaping, wide-mouthed, waddling
frog,&#8221; and so on all round the room. The leader then said,
&#8220;Two pudding-ends would choke a dog,&#8221; continuing in the
same way until twelve was reached. Chambers does not
describe the way the game given by him was played, but it
was probably much in the same manner. Rimbault&#8217;s <i>Nursery
Rhymes</i> gives the <a href="#TuneChristmas">tune</a> to which words of the song were repeated.
The words given are almost identical with <a href="#ChristmasI">No. I.</a>, but
the tune, copied <a href="#TuneChristmas">here</a>, is the only recorded one I have found.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) It seems probable that we have in these rhymes a
remnant of a practice of singing or chanting carols or rhymes
relating to the custom of sending gifts to friends and relatives
during the twelve days of Christmas. The festival of the
twelve days was an important one. The great mid-winter
feast of Yule consisted of twelve days, and from the
events occurring during those days it is probable that events
of the future twelve months were foretold.&#8212;On the festival of
the twelve days consult Keary&#8217;s <i>Outlines of Primitive Belief</i>,
p. 381. Miss Burne records that the twelve days rule the
year&#8217;s weather; as the weather is on each day of the twelve,
so will it be in the corresponding month, and for every mince-pie
eaten in friends&#8217; houses during these days a happy month
is promised. In the games usually played at this season, viz.,
those in which forfeits are incurred, and the redemption of
these by penances inflicted on the unhappy perpetrators of
mistakes, we may perhaps see a relic of the observance of
certain customs and ceremonies, and the penalties likely to be
incurred by those persons who omitted to religiously carry
them out. It is considered unlucky in the North of England
and Scotland to enter a neighbour&#8217;s house empty-handed.
Christmas bounties, and the practice of giving presents of food
and corn and meal on St. Thomas&#8217;s Day, 21st December, to
the poorer people, when they used to go round to the farmers&#8217;
houses to collect food to prepare for this festival, may have
had its origin in the idea that nothing could be prepared or
cooked during the festival of the twelve days. It was a very
general practice for work of all kinds to be put entirely aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_321" id="PageII_321">[321]</a></span>
before Christmas and not resumed until after Twelfth Day.
Dr. Gregor records that no bread should be baked nor washing
done during this period, nor work left unfinished. Jamieson,
in a note on Yule, says that the <i>gifts</i> now generally conferred
at the New Year seem to have originally belonged to Yule.
Among the northern nations it was customary for subjects
at this season to present gifts to their sovereign,&#8212;these
were called Jolagiafir, <i>i.e.</i> Yule gifts. The custom in Scotland
of presenting what we vulgarly call a sweetie-skon, or a loaf
enriched with raisins and currants, has an analogy to this.</p>

<p>It is difficult, with the scanty evidence at command, to do
more than make the simple suggestions above. The game is
evidently in a process of very rapid decadence, and we have
probably only poor specimens of what was originally the form
of verses sung in the two versions from <a href="#ChristmasI">Halliwell</a> and <a href="#ChristmasII">Chambers</a>.
The London version, <a href="#ChristmasIII">No. III.</a>, is only recognisable as belonging
to this game from the fact that it was known as playing at the
&#8220;twelve days,&#8221; was always played on Twelfth Day, and it was
not considered proper nor polite for the guests to depart until
this had been played. This fact has induced me to add the
<a href="#ChristmasIV">fourth version</a> from Halliwell, because it appears to me that it
may belong to the final form which this game is taking, or
has taken, namely, a mere collection of alliterative nursery
words, or rhymes, to puzzle the speaker under a rapid repetition,
and to exact forfeits for the mistakes made.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <a href="#UncleShrewsbury">Shropshire version</a> is played by the children forming
a ring by joining hands. After the eighth line is sung all
the children stoop down&#8212;the last to do so has to tell her
sweetheart&#8217;s name. In the <a href="#UncleNairn">Scotch version</a> the players stand
in a row. They sing the first five lines, then one player is
chosen (who chooses another); the other lines are sung, and the
two shake hands. Another version from Scotland (Laurieston
School, Kirkcudbright, Mr. J. Lawson), is very similar to the
one from <a href="#UncleNairn">Nairn</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Newell (p. 72) gives versions of this game which are
fuller and more complete than those given here. He thinks
it bears traces of ancient origin, and may be the last echo
of a medi&aelig;val song, in which an imprisoned knight is saved
from approaching death by the daughter of the king, or soldan,
who keeps him in confinement.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In the <a href="#StreetsLiverpool">Liverpool version</a> the children stand in a ring and

to sing, and the others address her particularly. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_324" id="PageII_324">[324]</a></span>
verse is ended she turns her back to the inside of the ring. All
do this in turn. The <a href="#StreetsMonton">Monton game</a> is played the same as

the slums of London. In <i>Gammer Gurton&#8217;s Garland</i> (1783,

<p><a name="Wadds1Mactaggart" id="Wadds1Mactaggart"></a>Mactaggart, in describing this, says it is one of the most
celebrated amusements of the Ingle ring. To begin it, one
in the ring speaks as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I hae been awa at the wadds and the wears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These seven lang years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come hame a puir broken ploughman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What will ye gie me to help me to my trade?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He may either say he&#8217;s a &#8220;puir broken ploughman&#8221; or any
other trade, but since he has chosen that trade some of the
articles belonging to it must always be given or offered to recruit
it. But the article he most wants he privately tells one of the
party, who is not allowed to offer him anything, as he knows
the thing, which will throw the offerer in a wadd, and must be
avoided as much as possible, for to be in a wadd is a very
serious matter. Now, the one on the left hand of the &#8220;poor
ploughman&#8221; makes the first offer by way of answer to what
above was said&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ll gie ye the coulter to help ye to your trade.&#8221;
The ploughman answers, &#8220;I don&#8217;t thank ye for the coulter; I
hae ane already.&#8221; Then another offers him another article
belonging to the ploughman&#8217;s business, such as the moolbred,
but this also is refused: another gives the sock, another the
stilts, another the spattle, another the naigs, and so on until
one gives the soam, which was the article he most wanted, and
was the thing secretly told to the one player. This throws the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_325" id="PageII_325">[325]</a></span>
giver into a wadd, out of which he is relieved in the following
manner:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The ploughman says to the one in the wadd, &#8220;Whether will
ye hae three questions and two commands, or three commands
and two questions to answer, or gang on wi&#8217;, sae that ye may
win out o&#8217; the wadd?&#8221; For the one so fixed has always the
choice which of these to take. Suppose he takes the first, two
commands and three questions, then a specimen of these may
be&#8212;&#8220;I command ye to kiss the crook,&#8221; says the ploughman,
which must be completely obeyed by the one in the wadd; his
naked lips must kiss the sooty implement. Secondly, says
the ploughman, I command ye to stand up in that neuk
and say<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Here stan&#8217; I, as stiff&#8217;s a stake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wha &#8217;ill kiss me for pity&#8217;s sake?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which must also be done; in a corner of the house must he
stand and repeat this couplet, until some tender-hearted lass
relieves him. Then the questions are asked, such as&#8212;&#8220;Suppose
you were in a bed with Maggie Lowden and Jennie Logan, your
twa great sweethearts, what ane o&#8217;m wad ye ding owre the
bedside, and what ane wad ye turn to and clap and cuddle?&#8221;
He has to choose one, perhaps to the great mirth of the company.
Secondly, &#8220;Suppose ye were stannin&#8217; stark naked on
the tap o&#8217; Cairnhattie, whether wad ye cry on Peggie Kirtle or
Nell o&#8217; Killimingie to come wi&#8217; your claise?&#8221; He has again to
choose. Lastly, &#8220;Suppose ye were in a boat wi&#8217; Tibbie Tait,
Mary Kairnie, Sally Snadrap, and Kate o&#8217; Minnieive, and it
was to coup wi&#8217; ye, what ane o&#8217; &#8217;em wad ye sink? what ane
wad ye soom? wha wad ye bring to lan&#8217;? and wha wad ye
marry?&#8221; Then he has again to choose between the girls
named.</p>

<p>A refusal must be atoned for by a wadd or forfeit. A piece of
money, a knife, or any little thing which the owner prizes, will
serve. When a sufficient number of persons have made
forfeits, the business of redeeming them is commenced, and
generally it is then that the amusement is greatest. The duty
of kissing some person, or some part of the room, is usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_327" id="PageII_327">[327]</a></span>
assigned as a means of redeeming one&#8217;s wadds. Often for this
purpose a lad has to kiss the very lips he formerly rejected;
or, it may be, he has to kneel to the prettiest, bow to the
wittiest, and kiss the one he loves best before the forfeit is
redeemed.&#8212;The substance of the above is from a note in
Cromek&#8217;s <i>Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song</i>, p. 114,
who says&#8212;In this game formerly young men and women
arranged themselves on each side of the fire, and alternately
bestowed husbands and wives on each other. Carleton&#8217;s
<i>Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry</i>, p. 106, also describes
the game without any material difference.</p>

<p><a name="Wadds1Dumfriesshire" id="Wadds1Dumfriesshire"></a>Another form of this game, practised in Dumfriesshire in
the last century, and perhaps still, was more common. The
party are first fitted each with some ridiculous name, not very
easy to be remembered, such as <i>Swatter-in-the-Sweet-Milk</i>,
<i>Butter-Milk-and-Brose</i>, <i>the Gray Gled o&#8217; Glenwhargan Craig</i>,
&amp;c. Then all being seated, one comes up, repeating the
following rhymes<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never stealt Rob&#8217;s dog, nor never intend to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But weel I ken wha stealt him, and dern&#8217;d him in a cleugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pykit his banes bare, bare, bare eneugh!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wha but &#8212;&#8212; wha but &#8212;&#8212;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The object is to burst out suddenly with one of the fictitious
names, and thus take the party bearing it by surprise. If the
individual mentioned, not immediately recollecting the name
he bore, failed, on the instant, to say &#8220;No me,&#8221; by way of
denying the accusation respecting the dog, he was subjected
to a forfeit; and this equally happened if he cried &#8220;No me,&#8221;
when it was the name of another person which was mentioned.
The forfeits were disposed of as in the former case.&#8212;<i>Popular
Rhymes</i>, pp. 125-126.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the first version of <a href="#Wadds1Chambers">Chambers</a> more
nearly resembles &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_280">Hey Wullie Wine</a>&#8221; (vol. i. p. 207), and that
the latter part of the version given by <a href="#Wadds1Mactaggart">Mactaggart</a> is similar to
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_199">Three Flowers</a>&#8221; (ante, p. 255, and the first part to &#8220;<a href="#GameII_227">Trades</a>,&#8221;
p. 305). Mr. W. Ballantyne sent me a version from Biggar as
played when he was a boy. It is similar to <a href="#Wadds1Mactaggart">Mactaggart&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>This game may indicate an earlier form of playing at forfeits<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_328" id="PageII_328">[328]</a></span>
than the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_7">Old Soldier</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_247">Turn the Trencher</a>,&#8221; and kindred
English games. Mactaggart does not state that any article
belonging to the person who perpetrates the offence was
given up and afterwards redeemed by the owner performing
a penalty. In Chambers&#8217; versions this is done. It may be
that, in Mactaggart&#8217;s case, each offending person paid his or
her penalty immediately after committing the blunder or
offence instead of a leader collecting the forfeits from all
offenders first, and then &#8220;crying&#8221; all together afterwards.
Whether the game originated in the practice of &#8220;tabu,&#8221; or
was an outcome of the custom of restitution, or ransom, legally
made for the commission of crimes, such as that called wergeld,
the penalty or price to be paid to the relatives of a slain man,
or of punishment for certain offences then being in the hands
of a certain class of people, we cannot now decide; but it
was customary for penalties to be attached to the commission
of minor offences, and the punishment enforced without appeal
to any legally constituted authority. The object of most of the
present forfeit games seems to have been to make the offenders
ridiculous, or, in the case of the above form of games, to
find out the person loved or hated. In Shropshire &#8220;Crying
the Weds&#8221; is the name given to the game of playing at
forfeits. Wadd means a pledge. Jamieson says &#8220;Wears&#8221;
signifies the &#8220;Wars.&#8221; &#8220;At the wars&#8221; is a common mode
still retained of describing the life of a soldier. Ihre supposes
that the early term wadd or wed is derived from wadd-cloth,
from this kind of merchandise being anciently given and
received instead of money; when at any time a pledge was
left, a piece of cloth was used for this purpose, and hence a
pledge in general would be called wadd.</p>

<p>In Waldron&#8217;s description of the Isle of Man (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_225">ante</a>, vol. i.
p. 139) is an account of a Twelfth Day custom which throws
light on the game as described by Chambers.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_255" id="GameII_255"></a>Wadds and the Wears (2)</h3>

<p>Jamieson describes the game differently. He says&#8212;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_329" id="PageII_329">[329]</a></span>
players being equally divided, and a certain space being marked
out between them, each lays down one or more wadds, or
pledges, at that extremity where the party to which he belongs
choose their station. A boundary being fixed, the object is to
carry off the wadds from the one of these to the other. The
two parties advancing to the boundary seize the first opportunity
of crossing it, by making inroads on the territories
of the other. If one who crosses the line is seized by the
opposite party before he has touched any of their wadds, he
is set down beside them as a prisoner, and receives the name
of a &#8220;stinker;&#8221; nor can he be released until one of his own
party can touch him without being intercepted by any of the
others, in which case he is free. If any one is caught in the
act of carrying off a wadd, it is taken from him; but he cannot
be detained as a prisoner, in consequence of his having touched
it. If he can cross the intermediate line with it, the pursuit is
at an end. When one party has carried off to their ground
all the wadds of the other the game is finished.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_256" id="GameII_256"></a>Waggles</h3>

<p>A game of <a href="#GameII_214">tip-cat</a>. Four boys stand at the corners of a
large paving-stone; two have sticks, the other two are feeders,
and throw the piece of wood called a &#8220;cat.&#8221; The batters act
much in the same way as in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_163">cricket</a>, except that the cat must
be hit whilst in the air. The batter hits it as far away as
possible, and whilst the feeder is fetching it, gets, if possible,
a run, which counts to his side. If either of the cats fall to
the ground both batters go out, and the feeders take their place.
A game called &#8220;Whacks&#8221; is played in a similar way.&#8212;London
Streets (F. H. Low, <i>Strand Magazine</i>, Nov. 1891).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The children form a ring by joining hands. They all
dance slowly round, singing the words. When the one child
is named by the ring she turns round, so that her face is turned
to the outside of the ring and her back inside. She still clasps
hands with those on either side of her, and dances or walks
round with them. This is continued until all the players have
turned and are facing outwards.</p>

<p>This concludes the game in many places, but in others the
game is continued by altering the last line of the verses, and
the children alternately turning round when named until they
all face inside again. In some of the versions the first child
to turn her face to the wall is the youngest, and it is then continued
by the next youngest, until the eldest is named. This
obtains in <a href="#WallflowersHampshire">Hampshire</a> (Miss Mendham), <a href="#WallflowersNottingham">Nottingham</a>, <a href="#WallflowersSymondsbury1">Symondsbury</a>,
<a href="#WallflowersEllesmere">Shropshire</a>, <a href="#WallflowersBeddgelert">Beddgelert</a>, <a href="#WallflowersSheffield">Sheffield</a>, <a href="#WallflowersCFerry">Connell Ferry, Oban</a>,
<a href="#WallflowersHersham">Hersham</a>, <a href="#WallflowersBarnes">Surrey</a>, <a href="#WallflowersDyke">Dyke</a>. In the <a href="#WallflowersLondon">London</a> (Miss Chase) and
<a href="#WallflowersSheffield">Sheffield versions</a> the child named leaves the ring and turns
with her face to a wall. In the <a href="#WallflowersWakefield">Wakefield version</a> Miss Fowler
says a child stands in the middle, and at the fifth line all the
children say their own name. At the end of the verse they all
unclasp hands, and turn with their faces outside the circle; the
verse is repeated, when they all turn again facing inwards, and
so on over again. In the Nairn version, after all the players
have turned their faces outside the ring, they all throw their
arms over their heads, and turn so as to face inwards if possible
without disjoining hands. The children at <a href="#WallflowersOgbourne">Ogbourne, Wilts</a>,
clap hands when singing the last two lines of the verses. At
<a href="#WallflowersEnbourne">Enbourne School</a> it is the tallest child who is first named, and
who turns her back; presumably the next tallest is then chosen.
In the <a href="#WallflowersSuffolk">Suffolk game</a> one child stands outside the ring; the ring
sings the first four lines, and the child outside sings the rest.
At <a href="#WallflowersEllesmere">Wenlock</a> Miss Burne says each child is summoned in turn
by name to turn their heads when the last line is said. At <a href="#WallflowersHurstmonceux">Hurstmonceux</a>
a girl chooses a boy after her face is turned to the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_341" id="PageII_341">[341]</a></span>(<i>d</i>) The most interesting point about this game is that it
appears to refer to a custom or observance which particularly
concerns young girls. We cannot say what the custom or
observance was originally, but the words point to something
in which a young maiden played the principal part. &#8220;We are
all maidens&#8221; and &#8220;she&#8217;s the youngest here&#8221; runs through
most of the versions. A death seems to be indicated, and it
may be that this game was originally one where the death of
the betrothed of the youngest maiden was announced. This
would account for the &#8220;turning the face to the wall,&#8221; which is
indicative of mourning and great sorrow and loss. The mention
of the girl&#8217;s accomplishments may mean that being so young
and accomplished she would quickly get another suitor, and this
might also account for the &#8220;fie for shame!&#8221;&#8212;shame to be
thinking of another lover so soon; or, on the other hand, the
other maidens may regret that by the loss of her lover and
betrothed this young maiden&#8217;s talents will be lost in &#8220;old
maidenhood,&#8221; as she will not now be married, and this will be
&#8220;a shame.&#8221; She will be, in fact, &#8220;on the shelf&#8221; or &#8220;out of
sight&#8221; for the rest of her life, and through no fault of her own.
The &#8220;we are all maidens&#8221; might refer to the old custom of
maidens carrying the corpse of one of their number to the
grave, and the words may have originally been the lament over
her death.</p>

<p>With reference to the words &#8220;turn the candlestick,&#8221; which
occurs in six versions, &#8220;M. H. P.,&#8221; in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (7th
ser., xi. 256), says: &#8220;<i>Turning the Candlestick</i>.&#8212;A candlestick
in the game of &#8217;<a href="#GameII_133">See-saw</a>&#8217; is the Yorkshire name for the
child who stands in the centre of the plank, and assists the
motion by swaying from side to side.&#8221; Toone (<i>Etymological
Dictionary</i>) says&#8212;Before the introduction of the modern candlestick,
the custom was to have the candle held by a person
appointed for that purpose, called a candle-holder, and hence
the term became proverbial to signify an idle spectator.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be a candle-holder and look on.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A candle-holder sees most of the game.&#8221;&#8212;Ray&#8217;s <i>Proverbs</i>.</p>

<p>If this should be the meaning of the phrase in these rhymes,
&#8220;she can turn the candlestick&#8221; may have originally meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_342" id="PageII_342">[342]</a></span>
that now this maiden can be nothing but a &#8220;looker on&#8221; or
&#8220;candle-holder&#8221; in the world. The meaning has evidently
been forgotten for a long time, as other expressions, such as
&#8220;she can turn the organ,&#8221; have had to be adopted to &#8220;make
sense&#8221; of the words.</p>

<p>Aubrey (<i>Remaines of Judaisme</i>, p. 45) mentions the sport
called &#8220;Dancing the Candlerush,&#8221; played by young girls; in
Oxford called &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_384">Leap Candle</a>,&#8221; which consisted of placing a
candle in the middle of the room and &#8220;dancing over the
candle back and forth&#8221; saying a rhyme. This may be the
&#8220;dance&#8221; referred to in the rhymes.</p>

<p>The <a href="#WallflowersTune">tune</a> of most versions is the same. It is pretty and
plaintive, and accords with the idea of mourning and grief.
The Rev. W. D. Sweeting says the tune in Northants seems
to be lost. The game is sung to a sort of monotone.</p>

<p>Northall gives a version from Warwickshire similar to several
given here, and Mr. Newell (<i>Games and Songs of American
Children</i>) gives a version and tune which is similar to that of
<a href="#WallflowersHurstmonceux">Hurstmonceux</a>, Surrey.</p>

<p>A sort of horse-game, in which two boys stand back to back
with their arms interlaced; each then alternately bends forward,
and so raises the other on his back with his legs in the air.
This term, too, is sometimes used for see-sawing.&#8212;Elworthy&#8217;s
<i>West Somerset Words</i>. Barnes (<i>Dorset Glossary</i>) calls this
game &#8220;Wayzalt.&#8221; Holloway (<i>Dict. Prov.</i>) says, in Hants the
game is called &#8220;Weighing.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The players divide into two sides of about equal numbers,
and form lines. The lines walk forwards and backwards in
turn, each side singing their respective verses alternately.
When the last verse is sung both lines prepare for a fight.</p>

<p>This is the usual way of playing, and there is but little
variation in the methods of the different versions. In some
versions (<a href="#RoversEnbourne">Enbourne</a>, Berks.; <a href="#RoversMaxey">Maxey</a>, Northants., and Bath)
sleeves are tucked up previous to the pretended fight, and in
one or two places sticks and stones are used; again in the
<a href="#RoversMaxey">Northamptonshire</a> and Bath games, at &#8220;Present! Shoot!
Bang! Fire!!&#8221; imitations are given of firing of guns before
the actual fight takes place. In the <a href="#RoversHWintney">Hants</a> (H. S. May) and
<a href="#RoversLancashire">Lancashire</a> (Mrs. Harley) versions, when the last verse is
reached the players all join hands, form a ring, and dance
round while they sing the last verse. In several versions too,
when they sing &#8220;We don&#8217;t care for the magistrates,&#8221; or other
persons of authority, the players all stamp their feet on the
ground. In the <a href="#RoversHurstmonceux">Hurstmonceux version</a> the children double
their fists before preparing to fight. Some pretend to have
swords to fight with, but the greater number use their fists.
In most of the versions the players on both sides join in the
refrain or chorus.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This game represents an attacking or invading party and
the defenders. It probably owes its origin to the border
warfare which prevailed for so long a period between Highlanders
and Lowlanders of Scotland, the Scotch and English of
the northern border counties, and in the country called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_357" id="PageII_357">[357]</a></span>
marches between Wales and England. Contests between
different nationalities living in one town or place, as at
Southampton and Nottingham, would also tend to produce
this game. That the game represents this kind of conflict
rather than an ordinary battle between independent countries
is shown by several significant points. These are, the dialogue
between the opposing parties before the fight begins, the mention
of bread, ale, or other food, and more particularly the
threat to appeal to the civil authorities, called in the different
versions, magistrates, blue coat men, red coat men, highest
men, policemen, and Cripple Dick. Such an appeal is only
applicable where the opposing parties were, theoretically at all
events, subordinate to a superior authority. The derision, too,
with which the threat is received by the assailants is in strict
accord with the facts of Border society. Scott in <i>Waverley</i>
and the <i>Black Dwarf</i> describes such a raid, and the suggestion
to appeal to the civil authority in lieu of a raid is met with the
cry of such an act being useless. The passage from the <i>Black
Dwarf</i> is: &#8220;&#8216;We maun tak the law wi&#8217; us in thae days,
Simon,&#8217; answered the more prudent elder. &#8216;And besides,&#8217;
said another old man, &#8216;I dinna believe there&#8217;s ane now living
that kens the lawful mode of following a fray across the
Border. Tam o&#8217; Whittram kend a&#8217; about it; but he died in
the hard winter.&#8217; &#8216;Hout,&#8217; exclaimed another of these discording
counsellors, &#8216;there&#8217;s nae great skill needed; just put
a lighted peat on the end of a spear, a hayfork, or siclike, and
blaw a horn and cry the gathering word, and then it&#8217;s lawful
to follow gear into England and recover it by the strong hand,
or to take gear frae some other Englishmen, providing ye lift
nae mair than&#8217;s been lifted frae you. That&#8217;s the auld Border
law made at Dundrennan in the days of the Black Douglas.&#8217;&#8221;
In <i>Waverley</i> the hero suggests &#8220;to send to the nearest garrison
for a party of soldiers and a magistrate&#8217;s warrant,&#8221; but is told
that &#8220;he did not understand the state of the country and of
the political parties which divided it&#8221; (chap. xv.). The position
of this part of the country is best understood from the evidence
of legal records, showing how slowly the king&#8217;s record ran in
these parts. Thus Mr. Clifford (<i>Hist. of Private Legislation</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_358" id="PageII_358">[358]</a></span>
quotes from Hodgson&#8217;s <i>Hist. of Northumberland</i> (vol. iii.
pt. 2, p. 171), a paper, in the Cotton MS., on &#8220;The bounds
and means of the &#8217;batable land belonging to England and
Scotland.&#8221; It was written in 1550 by Sir Robert Bowes, a
Northumbrian, at the request of the Marquis of Dorset, then
Warden General of the Marches, and gives a graphic picture
of Border life at that time. The writer describes Cassope
bridge as &#8220;a common passage for the thieves of Tyndalle, in
England, and for the thieves of Liddesdalle, in Scotland, with
the stolen goods from one realm to the other.&#8221; The head of
Tyndalle is a place &#8220;where few true men have list to lodge.&#8221;
North Tyndall &#8220;is more plenished with wild and misdemeaned
people&#8221; than even South Tyndall. The people there &#8220;stand
most by four surnames,&#8221; the Charltons, Robsons, Dodds, and
Milbornes. &#8220;Of every surname there be sundry families, or
graves, as they call them, of every of which there be certain
headsmen that leadeth and answereth for all the rest. There
be some among them that have never stolen themselves, which
they call true men. And yet such will have rascals to steal
either on horseback or foot, whom they do reset, and will
receive part of the stolen goods. There be very few able men
in all that country of North Tyndalle, but either they have
used to steal in England or Scotland. And if any true man
of England get knowledge of the theft or thieves that steal his
goods in Tyndalle or Ryddesdale, he had much rather take a
part of his goods again in composition than pursue the extremity
by law against the thief. For if the thief be of any
great surname or kindred, and be lawfully executed by order
of justice, the rest of his kin or surname bear as much malice,
which they call deadly feade (feud), against such as follow the
law against their cousin the thief, as though he had unlawfully
killed him with a sword; and will by all means they can seek
revenge thereupon.&#8221; At sundry times the dalesmen &#8220;have
broken out of all order, and have then, like rebels or outlaws,
committed very great and heinous attempts, as burning and
spoiling of whole townships and murdering of gentlemen and
others whom they have had grief or malice unto, so that for
defence of them there have been great garrisons laid, and raids<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_359" id="PageII_359">[359]</a></span>
and incourses both against them and by them, even as it were
between England and Scotland in time of war. And even at
such times they have done more harm than they have received.&#8221;
A number of the Tyndaller&#8217;s houses are set together, so that
they may give each other succour in frays, and they join
together in any quarrel against a true man, so that for dread
of them &#8220;almost no man dare follow his goods stolen or spoiled
into that country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sides in the game are under the different names or leadership
of Romans and English, King William&#8217;s men, rovers and
guardian soldiers, Prince Charlie&#8217;s men, King George&#8217;s men, &amp;c.
These names have probably been given in memory of some local
rising, or from some well-known event which stamped itself upon
the recollection of the people. It is very curious that in four or
five versions a refrain, which may well be a survival of some
of the slogans or family &#8220;cries&#8221; (see &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>&#8221;), should
occur instead of the &#8220;Roman&#8221; and &#8220;English&#8221; soldiers, &amp;c.
These refrains are, &#8220;My theerie and my thorie,&#8221; &#8220;Metherie and
metharie,&#8221; &#8220;Methory I methory,&#8221; &#8220;Come a theeiry, come a
thory,&#8221; &#8220;Come a theory, oary mathorie,&#8221; &#8220;Cam a teerie, arrie
ma torry,&#8221; and the three which apparently are still further degradations
of these, &#8220;Ye o&#8217; the boatmen,&#8221; &#8220;Drunk and sober,&#8221;
&#8220;He I over.&#8221; That &#8220;slogans&#8221; or &#8220;war cries&#8221; were used in
this species of tribal war there is little doubt. In the <a href="#RoversNorthumberland">Northumberland</a>
and <a href="#RoversKirkcudbright">Laurieston versions</a> the name is &#8220;Cripple
Dick,&#8221; these words, now considered as the name of a powerful
and feared leader, may also indicate the same origin. The
versions with these refrains come from <a href="#RoversPertshire">Perthshire</a> (three
versions), <a href="#RoversAuchencairn">Auchencairn</a>, and <a href="#RoversNorthumberland">Northumberland</a>; <a href="#RoversEHeaton">Yorkshire</a> has
He I over; while the Romans and English, King George&#8217;s
men, King William&#8217;s men, guardian soldiers, rovers, &amp;c., are
found in <a href="#RoversEllesmere">Shropshire</a>, <a href="#RoversHanbury">Staffordshire</a>, <a href="#RoversDean">Gloucester</a>, <a href="#RoversWrotham">Kent</a>, <a href="#RoversHWintney">Hants</a>,
Bath, <a href="#RoversEnbourne">Berks</a>, <a href="#RoversMaxey">Northamptonshire</a>, <a href="#RoversHurstmonceux">Sussex</a>, some of which are
Border counties to Wales, and others have sea-coasts where
at different times invasions have been expected. In <a href="#RoversHurstmonceux">Sussex</a>,
Miss Chase says the game is said to date from the alarm of
Napoleon&#8217;s threatened landing on the coast; this is also said
in <a href="#RoversWrotham">Kent</a> and <a href="#RoversHWintney">Hampshire</a>. Miss Burne considers the game in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_360" id="PageII_360">[360]</a></span>
<a href="#RoversEllesmere">Shropshire</a> to have certainly originated from the old Border
warfare. She also considers that the bread and wine, barrels
of ale, &amp;c., are indications of attempts made to bribe the
beleaguered garrison and their willingness to accept it; but I
think it more probably refers to the fact that some food, cattle,
and goods were oftentime given to the raiders by the owners
of the lands as blackmail, to prevent the carrying off of all
their property, and to avoid fighting if possible. It will be
noticed that fighting ensues as the result of a sufficient quantity
of food and drink being refused. Scott alludes to the
practice of blackmail, having to be paid to a Highland leader
in <i>Waverley</i>, in the raid upon the cattle of the baron of
Bradwardine (see chap. xv.). The farms were scattered, and
before the defenders could combine to offer resistance, cattle
and goods would be carried off, and the ground laid waste, if
resistance were offered.</p>

<p>The tune of the <a href="#RoversMaxey">Northants game</a> (Rev. W. Sweeting) and
<a href="#RoversHWintney">Hants</a> (H. S. May) are so nearly like the <a href="#TuneRoversBath">Bath tune</a> that it
seemed unnecessary to print them. The tune of the Surrey
game is that of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_445">Nuts in May</a>.&#8221; The words of the Bath
version collected by me are nearly identical with the <a href="#RoversEllesmere">Shropshire</a>,
except that &#8220;We are the Romans&#8221; is said instead of
&#8220;We are the Rovers.&#8221; They are not therefore printed here,
but I have used this version in my <i>Children&#8217;s Singing Games</i>,
series I., <i>illustrated</i>. The tune of the <a href="#RoversHWintney">Hants version</a> (H. S.
May) is similar to that of <a href="#RoversWrotham">Wrotham</a>, Kent (Miss D. Kimball).<span class="addmark"><a href="#Add_82">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p class="source">&#8212;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, p. 65.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This game should be accompanied by a kind of pantomimic
dance, in which the motions of the body and arms express the
process of weaving, the motion of the shuttle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Mr. Newell (<i>Games and Songs of American Children</i>,
p. 80) mentions a dance called &#8220;Virginia Reel,&#8221; which he says
is an imitation of weaving. The first movement represents the
shooting of the shuttle from side to side and the passage of the
woof over and under the threads of the warp; the last movements
indicate the tightening of the threads and bringing
together of the cloth. He also says that an acquaintance told
him that in New York the men and girls stand in rows by
sevens, an arrangement which may imitate the different colours
of strands. Mr. Newell does not say whether any words are
sung during the dancing of the reel. Halliwell gives another
rhyme (p. 121), which may have belonged to this weaving
game. It is extremely probable that in these fragments
described by him we have remains of one of the old trade
dances and songs.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_263" id="GameII_263"></a>Weigh the Butter</h3>

<p>Two children stand back to back, with their arms locked.
One stoops as low as he can, supporting the other on his back,
and says, &#8220;Weigh the butter;&#8221; he rises, and the second stoops
in his turn with &#8220;Weigh the cheese.&#8221; The first repeats with<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_362" id="PageII_362">[362]</a></span>

<p>The players turn their backs to each other, and link their
arms together behind. One player then bends forward, and
lifts the other off his [her] feet. He rises up, and the other
bends forward and lifts him up. Thus the two go on bending
and rising, and lifting each other alternately, and keep repeating<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The children join hands and form a ring. They all dance
or walk round singing the words of the first two lines of each
verse. Then all standing still, they unclasp hands, and continue
singing the next two lines, and while doing so each child
performs some action which illustrates the events, work, condition,
or profession mentioned in the first line of the verse
they are singing; then rejoining hands they all dance round in a
circle again. The actions used to illustrate the different events
are: In the versions from <a href="#YoungGirlPlatt">Platt school</a>, for &#8220;young girl,&#8221; each
child holds out her dress and dances a step first to the right, then
to the left, two or three times, finishing by turning herself quite
round; for a &#8220;sweetheart,&#8221; the children turn their heads and
kiss their hands to the child behind them; for &#8220;got married<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_371" id="PageII_371">[371]</a></span>,&#8221;
they all walk round in ring form, two by two, arm in arm; for
having a baby, they each &#8220;rock&#8221; and &#8220;hush&#8221; a pretended
baby; when the baby dies, each pretends to cry; when the
husband dies, they throw their aprons or handkerchiefs over
their heads and faces; for &#8220;keeping a donkey,&#8221; each child pretends
to beat and drive the child immediately in front of her;
for &#8220;washerwoman,&#8221; each pretends to wash or wring clothes;
for a &#8220;beggar,&#8221; each drops curtseys, and holds out her hand
as if asking alms, putting on an imploring countenance. The
<a href="#YoungGirlBarnes">Barnes&#8217; version</a> is played in the same way, with the addition
of holding the hands together to represent a book, as if
learning lessons, for &#8220;schoolgirl&#8221;; pretending to hold a cane,
and holding up fingers for silence, when a &#8220;teacher&#8221;; when
&#8220;my husband did beat me,&#8221; each pretends to fight; and for
&#8220;my husband died,&#8221; each child walks round joyfully, waving
her handkerchief, and all calling out Hurrah! at the end; the
other verses being acted the same as at <a href="#YoungGirlPlatt">Platt</a>. The <a href="#YoungGirlLiphook">Liphook
version</a> is much the same: the children beckon with their
fingers when &#8220;wanting a sweetheart&#8221;; kneel down and pretend
to pray when &#8220;at church&#8221;; prod pretended &#8220;clothes&#8221; in a
wash-tub with a &#8220;dolly&#8221; stick when &#8220;I did peggy&#8221; is said; and
mourn for the &#8220;husband&#8217;s&#8221; death. In the <a href="#YoungGirlHanbury">Hanbury game</a>, the
children dance round or shake themselves for &#8220;flounces &#8220;; hold
up dresses and walk nicely for &#8220;lady&#8221;; bow to each other for
&#8220;gentlemen&#8221;; pretend to mend shoes when &#8220;cobblers&#8221;; brush
shoes for &#8220;shoeblack&#8221;; clap hands when the &#8220;husband&#8221; dies;
and kneel when they are &#8220;parsons.&#8221; In the <a href="#YoungGirlOgbourne">Ogbourne game</a>, the
children &#8220;hold up their dresses as ladies do&#8221; in the first verse;
take off their hats repeatedly when &#8220;gentlemen&#8221;; pretend to
cry when &#8220;schoolgirls&#8221;; walking round, swinging their arms,
and looking as cocky as possible, when &#8220;schoolboys&#8221;; patting
each other&#8217;s backs when &#8220;schoolmasters&#8221;; clapping hands for
&#8220;schoolmistresses&#8221;; stooping down and walking on all fours
for a &#8220;donkey&#8221;; and brushing shoes for &#8220;shoeblack.&#8221; In the
Shropshire games at <a href="#YoungGirlBerrington">Berrington</a>, each child &#8220;walks demurely&#8221;
for a good girl; puts finger on lip for &#8220;naughty girl&#8221;; walks
two and two, arm in arm, for &#8220;courting&#8221;; holds on to her dress
for &#8220;married&#8221;; whips the &#8220;baby,&#8221; and cries when it dies. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_372" id="PageII_372">[372]</a></span>
the <a href="#YoungGirlMDrayton">Market Drayton game</a>, each pretends to tear her clothes
for &#8220;naughty girl&#8221;; pretends to carry a bag for &#8220;schoolgirl&#8221;;
walk in pairs side by side for &#8220;courting&#8221;; the same,
arm in arm, for &#8220;married&#8221;; &#8220;hushes&#8221; for a baby, pretends to
pat on the back for sick baby; covers her face with handkerchief
when baby dies; pats her chest when husband is sick,
cries and &#8220;makes dreadful work&#8221; when he dies; puts on
handkerchief for a widow&#8217;s veil for a widow; hobbles along,
and finally falls down when &#8220;a hundred and four.&#8221; In the
<a href="#YoungGirlDorsetshire">Dorset game</a>, when at &#8220;service,&#8221; an imitation of scrubbing and
sweeping is given; walk in couples for sweethearts, and
married; the remaining verses the same as the <a href="#YoungGirlPlatt">Platt version</a>.
In the <a href="#YoungGirlFernham">Fernham game</a> the children shoot out their arms alternately
for a soldier; for a mower, they stand sideways and
pretend to cut grass; for hedge-cutter, they pretend to cut
with a downward movement, as with a belt [<i>qy.</i> bill] hook, the
other action similar to the <a href="#YoungGirlPlatt">Platt</a> and <a href="#YoungGirlBarnes">Barnes games</a>. In the
<a href="#YoungGirlFrodingham">Frodingham game</a> they stamp and pretend to drill for &#8220;schoolboys,&#8221;
pretend to sew as &#8220;schoolgirls,&#8221; kiss for &#8220;courting,&#8221;
put on a ring for &#8220;getting married,&#8221; run for a doctor when
&#8220;husband&#8221; is ill, punch and push each other for &#8220;soldiers,&#8221;
and haul ropes for &#8220;sailors.&#8221; In other versions, in which
carpenters, blacksmiths, farmers, bakers appear, actions showing
something of those trades are performed.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) It will be seen, from the description of the way this game
is played, that it consists of imitative actions of different
events in life, or of actions imitating trades and occupations. It
was probably at one time played by both girls and boys, young
men and young women. It is now but seldom played by boys,
and therefore those verses containing lines describing male
occupations are not nearly so frequently met with as those
describing girls&#8217; or womens&#8217; life only. Young girl, sweetheart,
or going courtin&#8217;, marriage, birth of children, loss of baby and
husband, widowhood, and the occupations of washing and
cleaning, exactly sum up the principal and important events in
many working womens&#8217; lives&#8212;comprising, in fact, the whole.
This was truer many years ago than now, and the mention
in many versions of school girl, teacher, governess, indicate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_373" id="PageII_373">[373]</a></span>
those versions the influence which education, first in the shape
of dame or village schools, Sunday schools, and latterly Board
schools, has had upon the minds and playtime of the children.
These lines may certainly be looked upon as introductions by
the children of comparatively modern times, and doubtless have
taken the place of some older custom or habit. This game is
exactly one of those to which additions and alterations of this
kind can be made without destroying or materially altering, or
affecting, its sense. It can live as a simple game in an almost
complete state long after its original wording has been lost or
forgotten, and as long as occupations continue and events
occur which lend themselves to dumb action. The origin of
the game I consider to be those dances and songs performed
in imitation of the serious avocations of life, when such ceremonies
were considered necessary to their proper performance,
and acceptable to the deities presiding over such functions,
arising from belief in sympathetic magic.</p>

<p>At harvest homes it was customary for the men engaged in
the work of the farm to go through a series of performances
depicting their various occupations with song and dance, from
their engagement as labourers until the harvest was completed,
and at some fairs the young men and women of the village, in
song and dance, would go through in pantomimic representation,
the several events of the year, such as courting, marriage,
&amp;c., and their several occupations.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most singular instance of imitative action being
used in a semi-religious purpose, is that recorded by Giraldus
Cambrensis in the twelfth century, who, speaking of the church
of St. Almedha, near Brecknock, says a solemn feast is held
annually in the beginning of August: &#8220;You may see men and
girls, now in the church, now in the churchyard, now in the
dance, which is led round the churchyard with a song, on a
sudden falling on the ground as in a trance, then jumping up
as in a frenzy, and representing with their hands and feet
before the people whatever work they have unlawfully done on
feast days; you may see one man put his hands to the plough,
and another, as it were, goad on the oxen, one man imitating a
shoemaker, another a tanner. Now you may see a girl with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_374" id="PageII_374">[374]</a></span>
distaff drawing out the thread and winding it again on the
spindle; another walking and arranging the threads for the
spindle; another throwing the shuttle and seeming to weave&#8221;
(<i>Itinerary of Wales</i>, chap. ii.).</p>

<p>For the significance of some of the pantomimic actions used,
I may mention that in Cheshire for a couple to walk &#8220;arm-in-arm&#8221;
is significant of a betrothed or engaged couple.</p>

<p>Other versions have been sent me, but so similar to those
given that it is unnecessary to give them here. The tunes
vary more. In some places the game is sung to that of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_445">Nuts

<p>A game occasionally played in Angus. A pin was stuck in the
centre of a circle, from which there were as many radii as there
were persons in the company, with two names of each person<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_375" id="PageII_375">[375]</a></span>
at the radius opposite to him. On the pin an index was placed,
and moved round by every one in turn, and at whatsoever
person&#8217;s radius it stopped, he was obliged to drink off his

<p>(<i>b</i>) The players stand in a circle, but they do not necessarily
hold hands, nor do they move round. One player
kneels or stands in the centre, and another walks round outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_379" id="PageII_379">[379]</a></span>
the circle. The child in the centre asks the questions,
and the child outside (Johnny Lingo) replies. When the last
answer is given, the outside player, or Johnny Lingo, touches
one of the circle on the back; this player, without speaking,
then follows Johnny Lingo and stands behind her holding
her by her dress, or round the waist. The dialogue is then
repeated, and another child taken. This is continued until all
the circle are behind Johnny Lingo. Then the child in the
centre tries to catch one of them, and Johnny Lingo tries
to prevent it; as soon as one player is caught she stands
aside, and when all are caught the game is over.</p>

<p>This is the usual way of playing. The variations are: in
<a href="#StonewallGalloway">Galloway</a>, <a href="#StonewallEnbourne">Enbourne</a>, <a href="#StonewallKeith">Keith</a>, and <a href="#StonewallHanbury">Hanbury</a>, the centre player
shuts her eyes, or is blindfolded. In the <a href="#StonewallEasther">Almondbury version</a>,
when the centre child gets up to look for his sheep, and
finds them (they do not stand behind Johnny Ringo, but
hide), they run about &#8220;baaing;&#8221; when he catches them he
pretends to cut their heads off. In <a href="#StonewallChambers">Chambers&#8217;s description</a>
of the game, all the players except two sit upon the ground
in a circle (sitting or lying down also obtains at <a href="#StonewallBarnes">Barnes</a>),
one of the two stands inside, and the other personates
&#8220;Bloody Tom.&#8221; Bloody Tom tries to carry off a player after
the dialogue has been said, and the centre child tries to
prevent this one from being taken, and the rest of the circle
&#8220;cower more closely round him.&#8221; In the <a href="#StonewallMacduff">Macduff version</a>,
when all the players have been taken, the centre child runs
about crying, &#8220;Where are all my chickens?&#8221; Some of the
&#8220;chickens,&#8221; on hearing this, try to run away from &#8220;Limping
Tom&#8221; to her, and he tries to prevent them. He puts them all
behind him in single file, and the centre child then tries to catch
them; when she catches them all she becomes Limping Tom,
and he the shepherd or hen. Dr. Gregor says (<a href="#StonewallKeith">Keith</a>)&#8212;The
game is generally played by boys; the keeper kneels or sits in
the middle of the circle; when all the sheep are gone, and
he gets no answers to his questions, he crawls away still
blindfolded, and searches for the lost sheep. The first player
he finds becomes keeper, and he becomes Bloody Tom. In
the <a href="#StonewallWinterton">Winterton version</a> (No. I.) there is a further dialogue. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_380" id="PageII_380">[380]</a></span>
game is played in the usual way at the beginning. When Jacko
Lingo says, &#8220;Follow me&#8221; (he had previously, when saying one
by one and two by two, &amp;c., touched three children on their
back in turn), the third one touched leaves the ring, and stands
behind him holding his clothes or waist. This is done until
all the children forming the circle are holding on behind him.
The child in the centre then asks the next question. When she
says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my black sheep,&#8221; she tries to dodge behind
Jacky Lingo, and catch the child behind him. When she
has done this she begins again at &#8220;Have you seen anything
of my black sheep,&#8221; until she has caught all the children
behind Jacky Lingo. In two versions, <a href="#StonewallDeptford">Deptford</a> and <a href="#StonewallBocking">Bocking</a>,
there is no mention of a player being in the centre, but this
is an obvious necessity unless the second player stands also
outside the circle. In the <a href="#StonewallRaunds">Raunds version</a> the ring moves slowly
round. In the <a href="#StonewallHampshire">Hants version</a> (Miss Mendham) the children sit
in a line. The thief takes one at a time and hides them, and the
shepherd pulls them out of their hiding-places. In the <a href="#StonewallEllesmere">Shropshire
game</a>, the chickens crouch down behind their mother,
holding her gown, and the fox walks round them.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game appears to represent a village (by the players
standing still in circle form), and from the dialogue the children
not only represent the village, but sheep or chickens
belonging to it. The other two players are&#8212;one a watchman
or shepherd, and the other a wolf, fox, or other depredatory
animal. The sheep may possibly be supposed to be in the
pound or fold; the thief comes over the boundaries from a
neighbouring village or forest to steal the sheep at night;
the watchman or shepherd, although at first apparently
deceived by the wolf, discovers the loss, and a fight ensues,
in which the thief gets the worse, and some of the animals,
if not all, are supposed to be recovered. The names used
in the game,&#8212;pen pound, pinfold, fold, stone wall, sunny
wall, sandy path, gravel path, sheep fold, garden, house,
are all indications that a village and its surroundings is
intended to be represented, and this game differs in that
respect from the ordinary <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_227">Fox and Geese</a> and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_272">Hen and
Chickens</a> games, in which no mention is made of these.</p>

<p>Halliwell records two versions (<i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, pp. 61, 68).
The words and method of playing are the same as some of those
recorded above. There is also a version in <i>Suffolk County Folk-lore</i>,
pp. 65, 66, which beginning with &#8220;Who&#8217;s going round
my little stony wall?&#8221; after the sheep are all stolen, continues
with a dialogue, which forms a part of the game of &#8220;Witch.&#8221;
The Rev. W. S. Sykes sends one from Settle, Yorkshire, the
words of which are the same as No. XIV., except that the last
line has &#8220;just one&#8221; instead of &#8220;buy one.&#8221; Mr. Newell gives
a version played by American children.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children form a ring by joining hands. One player
stands in the centre. The ring dance round singing the first
verse; the widow then chooses one player from the ring, who
goes into the centre with her, and the ring dances round
singing the second part. The one first in the centre then
joins the ring, and the second player becomes the widow and
chooses in her turn.</p>

<p>The players sit round a table under the presidency of a
&#8220;Buck.&#8221; Each person has his fingers clenched, and the
thumb extended. Buck from time to time calls out as suits
his fancy: &#8220;Buck says, Thumbs up!&#8221; or, &#8220;Buck says,
Thumbs down!&#8221; or, &#8220;Wiggle-waggle!&#8221; If he says &#8220;Thumbs
up!&#8221; he places both hands on the table, with the thumbs
sticking straight up. If &#8220;Thumbs down!&#8221; he rests his thumbs
on the table with his hands up. If &#8220;Wiggle-waggle!&#8221; he
places his hands as in &#8220;Thumbs up!&#8221; but wags his thumbs
nimbly. Everybody at the table has to follow the word of
command on the instant, and any who fail to do so are liable
to a forfeit.&#8212;Evan&#8217;s <i>Leicestershire Words</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_272" id="GameII_272"></a>Wild Boar</h3>

<p>&#8220;Shoeing the Wild Boar,&#8221; a game in which the player sits
cross-legged on a beam or pole, each of the extremities of
which is placed or swung in the eyes of a rope suspended
from the back tree of an outhouse. The person uses a switch,
as if in the act of whipping up a horse; when being thus
unsteadily mounted, he is most apt to lose his balance. If
he retains it, he is victor over those who fail.&#8212;Teviotdale
(Jamieson).</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_273" id="GameII_273"></a>Wild Birds</h3>

<p>&#8220;All the Wild Birds in the Air,&#8221; the name of a game in
which one acts the dam of a number of birds, who gives
distinct names of birds, such as are generally known to all
that are engaged in the sport. The person who opposes tries
to guess the name of each individual. When he errs he is
subject to a stroke on the back. When he guesses right he
carries away on his back that bird, which is subjected to a
blow from each of the rest. When he has discovered and
carried off the whole, he has gained the game.&#8212;Jamieson.
Jamieson adds that this sport seems only to be retained in
Abernethy, Perthshire; and it is probable, from the antiquity
of the place, that it is very ancient.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stir up the dumplings, the pot boils over,<br /></span>

<p>to the second part of the tune in 2-4 time. This is repeated,
all jumping simultaneously to the changed time, until there
is a general scrimmage, with shrieking and laughter, and a
break up. The players should look somewhat like a watch
spring. <img src="images/illo2400.png" alt="Spring" width="50" height="50" /> As soon as the last one is wound up, no

2-4 music.&#8212;Essex (Miss Dendy).</p>

<p>This game is called &#8220;Wind up the Watch&#8221; in Wolstanton,
North Staffordshire Potteries, and is played in the same manner.
The words are only, &#8220;Wind up the Watch,&#8221; and are said.
When all the players are wound up they begin to unwind,
saying, &#8220;Unwind the Watch.&#8221;&#8212;Miss Bush. Called &#8220;Wind
up Jack&#8221; in Shropshire. It is the closing game of any playtime,
and was played before &#8220;breaking-up&#8221; at a boys&#8217; school
at Shrewsbury, 1850-56. The players form a line hand in
hand, the tallest at one end, who stands still; the rest walk
round and round him or her, saying, &#8220;Wind up Jack! Wind
up Jack!&#8221; (or at Ellesmere, &#8220;Roll up the tobacco-box&#8221;), till
&#8220;Jack&#8221; is completely imprisoned. They then &#8220;jog up and
down,&#8221; crying, &#8220;A bundle o&#8217; rags, a bundle o&#8217; rags!&#8221;&#8212;Berrington,
Ellesmere (<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 521).</p>

<p>In Scotland the game is known as &#8220;<a href="#GameII_111">Row-chow-Tobacco</a>;&#8221;
a long chain of boys hold each other by the hands: they have
one standing steadily at one of the extremities, who is called
the <i>Pin</i>. Round him the rest coil like a watch chain round
the cylinder, till the act of winding is completed. A clamorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_386" id="PageII_386">[386]</a></span>
noise succeeds, in which the cry Row-chow-Tobacco prevails;
after giving and receiving the <i>fraternal hug</i>, they disperse, and
afterwards renew the process. In West of Scotland, it is
Rowity-chow-o&#8217;-Tobacco, pronounced, <i>rowity-chowity-bacco</i>,
and as the first syllable of each word is shouted, another hug
or squeeze is given. The game is not so common as formerly.
The same game is played in West Cornwall by Sunday-school
children at their out-of-door treats, and is called &#8220;Roll
Tobacco.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is known as &#8220;The Old Oak Tree&#8221; in Lincoln, Kelsey,

<p class="source">&#8212;Miss M. Peacock.</p>

<p>In Mid-Cornwall, in the second week in June, at St. Roche,
and in one or two adjacent parishes, a curious dance is performed
at the annual &#8220;feasts.&#8221; It enjoys the rather undignified
name of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_152">Snails Creep</a>,&#8221; but would be more properly
called the &#8220;Serpent&#8217;s Coil.&#8221; The following is scarcely a perfect
description of it:&#8212;&#8220;The young people being all assembled in
a large meadow, the village band strikes up a simple but lively
air and marches forward, followed by the whole assemblage,
leading hand-in-hand (or more closely linked in case of engaged
couples), the whole keeping time to the tune with a lively step.
The band, or head of the serpent, keeps marching in an ever-narrowing
circle, whilst its train of dancing followers becomes
coiled round it in circle after circle. It is now that the most
interesting part of the dance commences, for the band, taking
a sharp turn about, begins to retrace the circle, still followed as
before, and a number of young men, with long leafy branches
in their hands as standards, direct this counter movement with<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_387" id="PageII_387">[387]</a></span>
almost military precision.&#8221;&#8212;W. C. Wade (<i>Western Antiquary</i>,
April 1881).</p>

<p>From this description of the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_152">Snail Creep</a>,&#8221; it is not difficult
to arrive at an origin for the game. It has evidently
arisen from a custom of performing some religious observance,
such as encircling sacred trees or stones, accompanied by song
and dance. &#8220;On May Day, in Ireland, all the young men and
maidens hold hands and dance in a circle round a tree hung
with ribbons and garlands, or round a bonfire, moving in curves
from right to left, as if imitating the windings of a serpent.&#8221;&#8212;Wilde
(<i>Ancient Cures, Charms, and Usages of Ireland</i>, 106).</p>

<p>It is easy to conjecture how the idea of &#8220;winding up a
watch,&#8221; or &#8220;rolling tobacco,&#8221; would come in, and be thought
the origin of the game from the similarity of action; but it is,
I think, evident that this is not the case, from the words &#8220;a
bundle o&#8217; rags,&#8221; the mention of trees, and the &#8220;jogging&#8221; up
and down, to say nothing of the existence of customs in
Ireland and Wales similar to that of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_152">Snail Creep</a>.&#8221; It is
noticeable, too, that some of these games should be connected
with trees, and that, in the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_152">Snail Creep</a>&#8221; dance the young
men should carry branches of trees with them.</p>

<p>A ring is formed by the children joining hands, one player
standing in the centre. When asked, &#8220;Please tell me who
they be,&#8221; the girl in the middle gives the name or initials of a
boy in the ring (or <i>vice versa</i>). The ring then sings the rest
of the words, and the boy who was named goes into the centre.
This is the <a href="#WindDean">Forest of Dean</a> way of playing. In the <a href="#WindBerrington">Shropshire
game</a>, at the end of the first verse the girl in the centre beckons
one from the ring, or one volunteers to go into the centre; the
ring continues singing, and at the end the two children kiss;
the first one joins the ring, and the other chooses in his turn.
The other versions are played in the same way.</p>

<p>Northall (<i>English Folk-Rhymes</i>, p. 380) gives a version from
Warwickshire very similar.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_277" id="GameII_277"></a>Wink-egg</h3>

<p>Elworthy (<i>West Somerset Words</i>) says&#8212;When a nest is
found boys shout, &#8220;Let&#8217;s play &#8216;Wink-egg.&#8217;&#8221; An egg is placed
on the ground, and a boy goes back three paces from it, holding
a stick in his hand; he then shuts his eyes, and takes two
paces towards the egg and strikes a blow on the ground with
the stick&#8212;the object being to break the egg. If he misses,
another tries, and so on until all the eggs are smashed. In
Cornwall it is called &#8220;Winky-eye,&#8221; and is played in the spring.
An egg taken from a bird&#8217;s nest is placed on the ground, at
some distance off&#8212;the number of paces having been previously
fixed. Blindfolded, one after the other, the players attempt
with a stick to hit and break it.&#8212;<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 61.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_278" id="GameII_278"></a>Witch, The</h3>

<p>This game is played by nine children. One is chosen as
Mother, seven are chosen for her children, and the other is a
Witch. The Mother and Witch stand opposite the seven children.
The <i>Mother</i> advances and names the children by the
days of the week, saying<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Sunday, take care of Monday,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Monday, take care of Tuesday,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">Thursday, take care of Friday,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Friday, take care of Saturday.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take care the Old Witch does not catch you, and I&#8217;ll bring
you something nice.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Mother then goes away, and the Witch advances
saying<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Sunday, your mother sent me for your best bonnet, she
wants to get one like it for Monday. It is up in the top long
drawer, fetch it quick.</p>

<p>Sunday goes away, and the Witch then seizes Saturday and
runs off with her.</p>

<p>The Mother re-enters, and names the children again, Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, misses
Saturday, and says<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where&#8217;s Saturday?<br /></span>

<p>The children all cry and say<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Old Witch has got her.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This part is then repeated until the Witch has taken all the
children and put them in a corner one by one, and stands in
front to guard them. The Mother sets out to find the children,
she sees the Old Witch, and says to her<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Have you seen my children?</p>

<p><i>Witch.</i> Yes, I saw them walking down High Street.</p>

<p><i>Mother</i> then goes away, does not find them, and comes
back asking<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Have you seen my children?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Yes, I saw them going to school.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_392" id="PageII_392">[392]</a></p>

<p><i>Mother</i> then goes away, does not find them, and comes back

<p>Have you seen my children?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Yes, they are gone to church.</p>

<p><i>Mother</i> again goes away, does not find them, and comes back
asking<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Have you seen my children?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> They are having dinner&#8212;you can&#8217;t see them.</p>

<p><i>Mother</i> again goes away, does not find them, and comes back
asking<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Have you seen my children?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> They are in bed.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> Can&#8217;t I go up and see them?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Your shoes are too dirty.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> Can&#8217;t I take them off?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Your stockings are too dirty.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> Can&#8217;t I take them off?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Your feet are too dirty.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> Can&#8217;t I cut them off?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> The blood would run on the floor.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> Can&#8217;t I wrap them up in a blanket?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> The fleas would hop out.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> Can&#8217;t I wrap them up in a sheet?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> The sheet is too white.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> Can&#8217;t I ride up in a carriage?</p>

<p><i>W.</i> You would break the stairs down.</p>

<p>The children then burst out from behind the Witch and they
and the Mother run after her, crying out, &#8220;Burn the Old Witch.&#8221;
They continue chasing the Witch till she is caught, and the
child who succeeds in catching her, takes the part of the Witch
in the next game.&#8212;Dartmouth (Miss Kimber).</p>

<p>The children choose from their party an Old Witch (who is
supposed to hide herself) and a Mother. The other players
are the daughters, and are called by the names of the week.
The Mother says that she is going to market, and will bring
home for each the thing that she most wishes for. Upon this
they all name something. Then, after telling them upon no
account to allow any one to come into the house, she gives her<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_393" id="PageII_393">[393]</a></span>
children in charge of her eldest daughter, Sunday, and goes
away. In a moment, the Witch makes her appearance, and
asks to borrow some trifle.</p>

<p>Sunday at first refuses, but, after a short parley, goes into
the next room to fetch the required article. In her absence
the Witch steals the youngest of the children (Saturday), and
runs off with her. Sunday, on her return, seeing that the
Witch has left, thinks there must be something wrong, and
counts the children, saying, &#8220;Monday, Tuesday,&#8221; &amp;c., until
she comes to Saturday, who is missing. She then pretends to
cry, wrings her hands, and sobs out&#8212;&#8220;Mother will beat me
when she comes home.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the Mother&#8217;s return, she, too, counts the children, and
finding Saturday gone, asks Sunday where she is. Sunday
answers, &#8220;Oh, mother! an Old Witch called, and asked to
borrow &#8212;&#8212;, and, whilst I was fetching it, she ran off with
Saturday.&#8221; The Mother scolds and beats her, tells her to be
more careful in the future, and again sets off for the market.
This is repeated until all the children but Sunday have been
stolen. Then the Mother and Sunday, hand in hand, go off
to search for them. They meet the Old Witch, who has them
all crouching down in a line behind her.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Have you seen my children?</p>

<p><i>Old Witch.</i> Yes! I think by Eastgate.</p>

<p>The Mother and Sunday retire, as if to go there, but, not finding
them, again return to the Witch, who this time sends them
to Westgate, then to Southgate and Northgate. At last one of
the children pops her head up over the Witch&#8217;s shoulder, and
cries out, &#8220;Here we are, Mother.&#8221; Then follows this
dialogue:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><i>M.</i> I see my children, may I go in?</p>

<p><i>O. W.</i> No! your boots are too dirty.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> I will take them off.</p>

<p><i>O. W.</i> Your stockings are too dirty.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> I will take them off.</p>

<p><i>O. W.</i> Your feet are too dirty.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> I will cut them off.</p>

<p><i>O. W.</i> Then the blood will stream over the floor.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_394" id="PageII_394">[394]</a></p>

<p>The Mother at this loses patience, and pushes her way in, the
Witch trying in vain to keep her out. She, with all her children,
then chase the Witch until they catch her; when they
pretend to bind her hand and foot, put her on a pile, and burn
her, the children fanning the imaginary flames with their pinafores.
Sometimes the dialogue after &#8220;Here we are, mother,&#8221;
is omitted, and the Witch is at once chased.&#8212;Cornwall (<i>Folk-lore
Journal</i>, v. 53-54).</p>

<p>One child represents an old woman who is blind, and has
eight children. She says she is going to market, and bids her
eldest daughter let no one into the house in her absence. The
eldest daughter promises. Then a second old woman knocks,
and bribes the daughter, by the promise of a gay ribbon, to
give her a light. Whilst the daughter is getting the light, the
Witch steals a child and carries it off.</p>

<p>The daughter comes back, and makes all the other children
promise not to tell their Mother. The Mother returns and
says: &#8220;Are all the children safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>The daughter says, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;Then let me count them.&#8221;
The children stand in a row, and the Mother counts by placing
her hands alternately on their heads. The eldest daughter
runs round to the bottom of the row, and so is counted twice.</p>

<p>This is repeated until all the children are gone. At the end
the eldest daughter runs away, and the Mother finds all her
children gone. Then the Witch asks the old woman to dinner,
and the children, who have covered their faces, are served up as
beef, mutton, lamb, &amp;c. Finally they throw off their coverings
and a general scrimmage takes place.&#8212;London (Miss Dendy).</p>

<p>At Deptford the game is played in the same way, and the
dialogue is similar to the Cornish version, then follows<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll ride in a pan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That will do.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Mother gets inside to her children and says to them in
turn, &#8220;Poke out your tongue, you&#8217;re one of mine,&#8221; then they
run away home.&#8212;Deptford (Miss Chase).</p>

<p>In another Deptford version the children are named for days
of the week, the Mother goes out, and the Witch calls and asks<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>A number of girls stand in a line. Three girls out of the
number represent Mother, Jack, and Daughter. The Mother
leaves her children in charge of her Daughter, counts them,
and says the following:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>While the Mother is gone Jack comes and asks for a match;
he takes a child and hides her up. The Mother comes back,
counts her children, and finds one missing. Then she asks
where she is, and the Daughter says that Jack has got her.
The Mother beats the Daughter, and leaves them again, saying
the same words as before, until all the children have gone.&#8212;Ipswich

<p class="source">&#8212;Hersham, Surrey (<i>Folk-lore Record</i>, v. 88).</p>

<p>Halliwell gives a version of this which he calls the game of
the &#8220;Gipsy.&#8221; He gives no dialogue, but his game begins by<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_396" id="PageII_396">[396]</a></span>
the Mother saying some lines to the eldest daughter, which are
almost identical with those given from Hersham, Surrey. Mr.
Newell gives some interesting American versions.</p>

<p>This game appears in the versions given above to be a child-stealing
game, and it may originate from this being a common
practice some years ago, but it will be found on comparison
to be so much like &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_425">Mother, mother, the pot boils over</a>&#8221; (vol. i.
p. 396) that it is more probable that this is the same game,
having lost the important element of the &#8220;giving of fire,&#8221; or a
&#8220;light from the fire&#8221; out of the house, so soon as the idea that
doing this put the inhabitants of the house into the power of
the receiver or some evil spirit had become lost as a popular
belief. &#8220;Matches&#8221; being asked for and a &#8220;light&#8221; confirms
this. It will be seen that a Witch or evilly-disposed person
is dreaded by the Mother, the eldest Daughter being specially
charged to keep a good look-out. The naming of the children
after the days of the week, the counting of them by the Mother,
and the artifice of the eldest Daughter, in the London version,
who gets counted twice, are archaic points. The discovery by
tasting of the children by their Mother, and their suggested
revival; the catching and &#8220;burning&#8221; of the Witch in the
Dartmouth and Cornish games, are incidents familiar to us
from nursery tales and from the trials of people condemned for
witchcraft. Of the Cornish version it is said that &#8220;it has
descended from generation to generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Newell&#8217;s versions tend, I think, to strengthen my suggestion
in &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_425">Mother, the pot boils over</a>,&#8221; that the &#8220;fire&#8221; custom
alluded to is the origin of that game and this. The fire incident
has been forgotten, and the game therefore developed into a
child-stealing or gipsy game.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One player acts as Shepherd, and stands at one side of the
playground or field; another acts as Wolf. He crouches in one
corner, or behind a post or tree. The other players are sheep,
and stand close together on the opposite side of the ground to
the Shepherd. The Shepherd advances and calls the sheep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_398" id="PageII_398">[398]</a></span>
At the end of the dialogue the sheep run across to the Shepherd
and the Wolf pounces out, chases, and tries to catch them.
Whoever he catches has to stand aside until all are caught.
The game is played in this way in all versions sent me except
<a href="#WolfHurstmonceux">Hurstmonceux</a>, where there is the following addition:&#8212;The
Wolf chases until he has caught all the sheep, and put them in
his den. He then pretends to taste them, and sets them aside
as needing more salt. The Shepherd or Mother comes after
them, and the sheep cover their heads with their aprons. The
Mother guesses the name of each child, saying, &#8220;This is my
daughter &#8212;&#8212;. Run away home!&#8221; until she has freed them all.</p>

<p>Versions of this game, almost identical with the <a href="#WolfAnderby">Anderby
version</a>, have been collected from Sporle, Norfolk (Miss Matthews);
Crockham Hill, Kent (Miss E. Chase); Hersham,
Surrey (<i>Folk-lore Record</i>, v. p. 88); Marlborough, Wilts (H. S. May);
Ash and Barnes, Surrey (A. B. Gomme). In Nottinghamshire,
Derbyshire is the place the wolf is said to have gone
to. Mr. M. L. Rouse sends the following fuller description of
the game as played at Woolpit, near Haughley, Suffolk, which
gives, I think, the clue to the earlier idea of the game:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The game was played out of doors in a meadow. Two long
parallel lines were drawn about fifty yards apart, forming bases
behind them. Two boys stood some distance apart between
the bases, and the rest of the players all stood within one base.
One of the two boys in the centre acting as decoy cried &#8220;Sheep,
sheep, come home!&#8221; The sheep represented by the boys in
the base cried back, &#8220;We can&#8217;t, we&#8217;re afraid of the Wolf.&#8221; The
decoy then said<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wolf&#8217;s gone to Devonshire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And won&#8217;t be back for seven year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheep, sheep, come home.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sheep then made rushes from different points, and tried
to get across to the other base. The other player in the centre
tried to catch the sheep as they ran. Those caught joined
the side of the wolf, and caught others in their turn.</p>

<p>It appears clear that the &#8220;Decoy&#8221; is the correct character
in this game instead of a &#8220;shepherd&#8221; or &#8220;master,&#8221; as now given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_399" id="PageII_399">[399]</a></span>
The decoy is evidently assuming the character and voice of
the shepherd, or shepherd&#8217;s dog, to induce the sheep to leave
the fold where they are protected, in order to pounce upon
them as they endeavour to go in the direction the voice calls
them. The game owes its origin to times and places, when
wolves were prowling about at night, and sheep were penned
and protected against them by shepherds and watch-dogs.</p>

<h3><a name="GameII_281" id="GameII_281"></a>Wolf and the Lamb, The</h3>

<p>Two are chosen&#8212;one to represent the wolf and the other
the lamb. The other players join hands and form a circle
round the lamb. The wolf tries to break through the circle,
and carry off the lamb. Those in the circle do all they can to
prevent the wolf from entering within the circle. If he manages
to enter the circle and seize the lamb, then other two are
chosen, and the same process is gone through till all have got
a chance of being the lamb and wolf. This game evidently
represents a lamb enclosed in a fold, and the attempts of a wolf
to break through and carry it off.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The leader of this game stands in the middle, the players
stand in a ring round him; when there are a sufficient number
of players, several rings are formed one within the other,
the smallest children in the inner ring. The different rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_401" id="PageII_401">[401]</a></span>
move in alternate directions when dancing round. All the
children sing the words of each verse and dance round. They
unclasp hands at the end of each alternate verse, and suit their
actions to the words sung. At the end of the first verse they
stand still, crook their arms as if holding a basket, and imitate
action of sowing while they sing the second verse; they then all
dance round while they sing the third, then stand still again
and imitate reaping while they sing the fourth time. Then
again dance and sing, stand still and imitate &#8220;thrashing&#8221; of
barley and wheat; after &#8220;seed time is o&#8217;er,&#8221; they drop on
one knee and lift one hand as if in prayer, again dancing
round and singing. Then they kneel on one knee, put their
hands together, lay their left cheek on them, and close their
eyes as if asleep; while singing, &#8220;when his labour is o&#8217;er,&#8221; at
the last verse, they all march round, clapping hands in time.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="#PeasantMonton">Monton game</a>. The <a href="#PeasantFrodingham">Frodingham game</a> is played
in the same way, except that the children walk round in a
circle, one behind another, when they sing and imitate the
actions they mention. &#8220;When the hunting&#8217;s begun&#8221; they
all run about as if on horseback; &#8220;when the day&#8217;s work is
done,&#8221; they all kneel on one knee and rest their heads on
their hands.</p>

<p>This game is evidently a survival of the custom of dancing,
and of imitating the actions necessary for the sowing and reaping
of grain which were customary at one time. Miss Dendy
says&#8212;&#8220;It is an undoubtedly old Lancashire game. It is sometimes
played by as many as a hundred players, and is then
very pretty. The method of playing varies slightly, but it is
generally as described above.&#8221; The fact that this game was
played by such a large number of young people together,
points conclusively to a time when it was a customary thing
for all the people in one village to play this game as a kind
of religious observance, to bring a blessing on the work of
the season, believing that by doing so, they caused the crops
to grow better and produce grain in abundance.</p>

<h3><a name="Add_3" id="Add_3"></a>American Post.</h3>

<p>One player of a party acts as post and leaves the room.
When he is outside he knocks at the door. Another player,
who is the doorkeeper (inside), calls out, &#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221;
The reply is, &#8220;American post.&#8221; &#8220;What with?&#8221; &#8220;A letter.&#8221;
&#8220;For whom?&#8221; The name of one of the players in the room
is given by the post. The one named then must go outside,
and kiss the post, and in turn becomes post.&#8212;Fraserburgh
(Rev. Dr. Gregor).</p>

<p>This, sometimes called &#8220;Postman,&#8221; is now more generally
played as a penalty when forfeits are being performed. The
player whose penalty it is, is the first one to be &#8220;post.&#8221;
Postage is demanded, the amount being paid by kisses.</p>

The fool, called here &#8220;Bannockburn,&#8221; says, &#8220;Are ye it?&#8221; to
each player pointing to them in turn. When she points at the
correct one that player runs off. Bannockburn runs after and
tries to catch her. If the first runner can get back into the
row untouched she gets renamed, if caught she has to take
Bannockburn&#8217;s place.</p>

previously given.</p>

<p>The players join hands, form a circle and stretch out as far
as each one&#8217;s arms will allow. One player is outside the ring.
When she sees they can stretch no further she cries out
&#8220;Break,&#8221; when they all loose hands and stand as far apart as
possible. The player outside then goes round the ring singing,
&#8220;I have a black doggie, but it winna&#8217; bite you, nor you, nor
you,&#8221; until she comes to one whom she chooses; she then
throws the handkerchief down on the ground behind this one
quietly. If this player does not notice the handkerchief, not
one in the circle must tell her, or they are &#8220;out.&#8221; The player
who dropped the handkerchief walks round until she comes
again to the one behind whom she dropped it. She picks it
up and tells her she is &#8220;burnt.&#8221; Then this player has to
stoop down on her knees and is out of the game. Should the
selected player notice the handkerchief, she picks it up and
pursues the other round and through the ring, following
wherever the first one leads until she catches her; they then
change places; should she not follow the exact way the first
player went, she too is out and must go down on her knees.&#8212;Rosehearty

knees. The outside player goes round the circle three times,
first saying &#8220;Black Doggie winna tack you, nor you.&#8221; Then
she goes round again and drops the handkerchief behind any
one she pleases. She then runs and is pursued until caught,

<p>Players are chosen alternately by two chiefs. The line is
drawn between the two sides, and the caps of each side are
placed on the ground at each of the ends. When the two
sides are ranged, the players try to catch and pull each other
across the line. If one is pulled across he is called a &#8220;slink,&#8221;
and must stand till he is set at liberty by one of his own side
crossing the line and touching him. If this one manages to
touch him before he is crowned, <i>i.e.</i>, has the crown of his

regain his own side before the same operation takes place,
both are free. Each player watches an opportunity to gather
up the caps of the opposing side. If one is clever and swift
enough to reach the caps and gather them all before he is
crowned, his side wins.&#8212;Dyke School (Rev. Dr. Gregor.)</p>

one man takes a button, puts it between his two hands, and
goes round to each of the other players, who have their two
hands held out, palms together, saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell what you
got,&#8221; and quietly dropping the button into one player&#8217;s hands.
He then asks the first man, saying, &#8220;Who has the button?&#8221;
One player is named. The master of the game says then
&#8220;What forfeit will you give me that he has it?&#8221; The player
gives a forfeit. So on all round, every one guessing and giving
a forfeit (including he who holds the button, who, of course,
keeps his secret). When all the forfeits are in the master says,
&#8220;Button, button, show, and let all fools know;&#8221; then those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_409" id="PageII_409">[409]</a></span>
have guessed right receive back their forfeits. The holder of
the button then kneels down to deliver sentences on the others.
The master takes a forfeit and holds it over the kneeler&#8217;s
head, saying, &#8220;Fine, fine, superfine, what&#8217;s the owner of this
fine thing of [gentleman&#8217;s or lady&#8217;s] wear to do?&#8221; The man
kneeling gives a sentence, such as&#8212;to take the broom, ride
it three times round the room, and each time kiss the crook
hanging in the chimney&#8212;and so on.</p>

<p>If a man refuses to perform his sentence he is made to kneel
down, and everything that can be got hold of is piled on his
back.&#8212;Kiltubbrid, Co. Leitrim (L. L. Duncan).</p>

<p>Two versions of this, differing somewhat from those given
previously.</p>

<p>(1.) Played by two players. A hole is dug in the ground,
and one player with a &#8220;catch-brod&#8221; stands in a stooping
attitude in front of it, about a foot and a-half away, placing
one end of the &#8220;catch-brod&#8221; on the ground. The other player
goes to a distance of some yards, to a fixed point called &#8220;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_410" id="PageII_410">[410]</a></span>
stance.&#8221; From here he throws a ball, intending to land it in
the hole. The other player&#8217;s object is to prevent this by
hitting it away with his &#8220;catch-brod.&#8221; If the bowler succeeds
they change places.</p>

<p>(2.) This also is played by two players, and in the same way,
except that a stone is substituted for the hole, and the bowler&#8217;s
object is to strike the stone with the ball. Sometimes it is
played with three players, then running is allowed. When
the ball is hit the batter tries to run to the &#8220;stance&#8221; and
back, the bowler or the third player then tries to hit the
&#8220;stance&#8221; with the ball while the batter is away making the
run. If the third player can catch the ball before it touches
the ground he tries to hit the stone with it, thus sending the
batter out.&#8212;Keith (Rev. Dr. Gregor).</p>

<p>A game with peg tops played by two or more boys. A large
button, from which the shank has been removed, or a round
piece of lead about the size of a penny, is placed on the ground
between two agreed goals. The players divide into sides, each
side tries to send the button to different goals, the tops are
spun in the usual way, and then taken up on the hand while
spinning, and allowed to revolve once round the palm of the
hand, and then thrown on the ground on the button in such a
way that the button is projected some distance along the
ground. Then a boy on the opposite side spins his top and
tries to hit the button in the opposite direction. This is continued
alternately until one or other side succeeds in getting
the button to the goal.&#8212;London Streets (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>A game resembling &#8220;<a href="#GameII_213">Tip it</a>,&#8221; and a better form of the game.
The parties are decided by a toss up. The object is passed
from hand to hand under the table, until the leader of the
opposite side calls out &#8220;up&#8221; or &#8220;rise.&#8221; When all the closed
hands are on the table, the leader orders any hands off which
he thinks do not contain the object. If the last hand left on
the table contains the object the sides change places, if not the
same sides repeat, twelve successful guesses making &#8220;game,&#8221;
each failure counting one to the opposite side. The game is
called &#8220;Up Jenkins&#8221; in the North of Scotland. The words
have to be called out when the hands are called to show.
Another name is &#8220;Cudlums;&#8221; this word was called out when

of the human form was fastened on a cross, and sticks were
thrown at it, just after the fashion of the modern &#8220;Aunt Sally.&#8221;
But it is quite possible that this game, taken in connection with
the following very curious words which the children repeated
when throwing the sticks, is a survival of a more serious
function<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Moore writes that Kelly, who gives these words in his
Dictionary, says that Doagan was a play, and that it refers
to the head of Dagon being broken off. Does he mean the
Philistine god of that name? As he is capable of seeing a
reference to the god, Baal, in the Manx word for May-day,
Boaldyv, it is quite possible that his imagination may lead him
so far!&#8212;Isle of Man (A. W. Moore).</p>

The one having the handkerchief endeavours to drop it at some

If the player does not manage this she has to sit in the centre

<p>The players arrange themselves into a double circle with a
space between each pair. The one at the back stands and the
inside players kneel. Another player stands in the centre and
cries out, &#8220;Fire on the mountain; run, boys, run!&#8221; Those
players who are standing in the outer circle begin to run
round, those kneeling remaining in that position. They continue
running until the centre player cries &#8220;Stop!&#8221; They all
then (including the centre player) make a rush to get a stand
behind one of the kneeling players, the one who is left out
going into the centre.&#8212;Auchterarder, N.B. (Miss E. S.

<p>Played in the usual way with the following difference in
the formula. The leader says, &#8220;Fool, foolie, come to your

Fool is then chased off, recalled, and again questioned. Fool
answers, &#8220;Suppin&#8217; my porridge and readin&#8217; my Bible.&#8221; She
is then welcome, and asked in the usual way to point out one

<p>The players form a ring and dance round, getting quicker
as they sing &#8220;Three times round,&#8221; &amp;c. When the last line
is sung they let go hands and sink to the ground. The player
who sinks down first is taken away by the others and asked
whom he or she loves best. The ring is then reformed, and
the child who has given her sweetheart&#8217;s name is placed in the
centre. The ring then dances round singing out the name of
the sweetheart.</p>

<p>In another version called &#8220;Georgina&#8221; one player selected to
act as Georgina kneels down against a wall, and the others
stand round to conceal her. Two go apart to act as callers,
while another stands near the group as mother. The callers
come forward and say<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>They then retire, but return in a little while, and put the
question as before. She is then &#8220;starching,&#8221; said as above;
and next time she is &#8220;ironing,&#8221; the fourth time the mother&#8217;s

at her;&#8221; the sixth, she is &#8220;worse;&#8221; and the seventh, she is
&#8220;dead.&#8221; The two callers remain when this reply is given. At
this point Georgina makes a noise by rapping two stones
together. The two at once exclaim, &#8220;Oh! mother, mother,
what&#8217;s that knocking?&#8221; and she answers, &#8220;The coach going
by.&#8221; The knocking is repeated, and the question, and she
says, &#8220;The wall falling down.&#8221; On the knocking being heard
a third time, she tells them to &#8220;take a candle and look.&#8221; They
pretend to do so, and &#8220;Georgina&#8221; starts up to chase them.

<p>Many other versions have been sent me, but none with
different features. The best is one from Mr. J. G. Carter,
Dalry, Galloway, called &#8220;Jenny Jo,&#8221; but presenting no fresh
details, and where white is used for the burial. Four children
stand on one side with Jenny at their back, the other players on
the opposite. She is buried with great mourning. In a version
from Hemsby (Mrs. Haddon) the words are the same, except:
&#8220;White is the colour for weddings,&#8221; and black is for funerals.
Then Jenny is carried to the grave, the other children walking
behind two by two; they kneel round Jenny, and have a good
cry over her. Another version from Laurieston School (Mr.
J. Lawson), called &#8220;Jerico,&#8221; very similar to above, gives two
additional verses. The first lines are, &#8220;Carry a poor soldier to
the grave,&#8221; and &#8220;Now the poor mother&#8217;s weeping at the grave.&#8221;
In one version, after Jenny has been carried to her grave, the
children stand round and sprinkle earth over her, and say,
&#8220;Dust and dust, dust and dust,&#8221; and then pretend to strew
flowers. This I got in London. Another version from North
Scotland begins, &#8220;I come to see <i>Geneva</i>&#8221; continues in usual
way until &#8220;she is lying&#8221; instead of &#8220;ill&#8221;; then &#8220;she&#8217;s dying,&#8221;
followed by &#8220;she&#8217;s dead&#8221;; then the funeral. In another
version Dr. Haddon sent me, the game is only a fragment.
After &#8220;Jenny Jo&#8217;s dead and gone, all the day long,&#8221; they
continue, &#8220;Pipes and tobacco for Jenny Jo&#8221; (repeat twice),

&#8220;The Den,&#8221; from which he starts, and to which he and the

them, and beat them with their caps. The two now join hands,
and before leaving the den repeat the same words, and give
chase to catch another. When another is caught, the three
run to the den, followed by the others pelting them.</p>

<p>During the time they are running to catch another player,
every attempt is made by the others to break the band by

<h3><a name="Add_57" id="Add_57"></a>Leap-Frog.</h3>
<p class="noblank">[Vol. i. pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_222">133</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_385">327, 328</a>.]</p>

<p>The chief rules of this game, obtaining in N.E. Scotland in
Dr. Gregor&#8217;s boyhood, were:&#8212;The boy that stooped his back
was called &#8220;the bull,&#8221; pronounced &#8220;bill.&#8221; The bull was not to
&#8220;horn,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, throw up his back when the player placed his
hands on it to leap over, or to bend his back down, and that
the player was to lay his hands on the bull&#8217;s back quite flat,
and not to &#8220;knockle,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, drive the knuckles into it. The
best way to play was:&#8212;A line was drawn beside the bull,
over which the heel of the player must not pass. All the
players, the one after the other in succession, leaped over
the bull. The one last over called out, &#8220;Fit it,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, foot it,
which meant that the bull had to measure from the line a
breadth and a length of his foot. This done he stooped,
and all the players went over as before, and another breadth
and length of foot were added. This went on as long as
the players thought they were able to leap over the bull.
When they thought they could not do so, the last player called
out, &#8220;Hip it,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, take a hop. This done, the bull put himself
into position, and each player now took a hop from the line
to the bull, and then went over him. Here the same process of
footing was gone through as before, as long as the players were
able to go clear over the bull. Then came a step with as much
footing as was considered safe, and then came a jump with
so much footing. It was now with the players &#8220;hip, step, an&#8217;
jump,&#8221; and over the bull. Then more &#8220;fitin&#8217;,&#8221; and perhaps
another &#8220;hip,&#8221; and so on&#8212;two hips, two steps, two jumps, and
a flying leap over the bull. It was not often the game reached
this point. Some one of the players had failed to pass right
over the bull and caused him to fall, or had overstepped the
line. When any player did either the one or the other, he had
to become bull.&#8212;Keith (Rev. Dr. Gregor).</p>

<p>This is a fuller and more complete description than that of
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_223">Foot and Over</a>&#8221; (vol. i. p. 133).</p>

<p>Another mode of playing leap-frog is: the players stand
with their backs to the leapers, and only bend the head and
the leaper&#8217;s hands are placed between the shoulders. Instead
of running a few yards in front, each player advances only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_441" id="PageII_441">[441]</a></span>
few feet, leaving just as much room as to allow the player
scope to fall and spring again. This mode requires considerable
agility and practice. The higher the leap, so much the
greater the fun.&#8212;Keith (Rev. Dr. Gregor.)</p>

<p>Versions of this game from Scotland have been sent me,
which show great similarity to those previously printed, but
the game is more or less in a state of decadence. The best
version is that from <a href="#AddBridgePerth">Perth</a>. One from St. Andrews, Peterhead,
though only consisting of the first verse, has preserved the
refrains, &#8220;Dance o&#8217;er the Lady Lee&#8221; and &#8220;With a gay lady&#8221;
of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_396">Halliwell&#8217;s version</a>. The others commence &#8220;broken bridges.&#8221;
The <a href="#AddBridgeMan">Isle of Man version</a> is still more incomplete. A version
sent me by Dr. Haddon from Barrington is similar to the one
given, vol. i. p. 338-9, from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_396">Enborne School</a>, and is not therefore

<p>The one in the centre chooses two from the ring, and retires
with them a short distance away, when the name of a boy is
selected as the lover. During the time the three are standing
apart, those in the ring let go each other&#8217;s hands, and take

<p>The blindfolded tries to catch one in the ring. The ring
should not break, but it is often broken by the one that is on
the eve of being caught. The one caught takes her stand in
the centre, and the game begins anew from that point.&#8212;Dyke

<p>This is a most interesting variant of this game&#8212;blindfolding
the bridegroom in order that he must first catch his bride,
and her attempts to elude his caresses, are significant of early
custom.</p>

<p>Another version of this game. It is begun in the same way.
As each player gets his name, he or she turns their back to the
namer. When all are named, and are standing with their
backs to the namer, the namer calls out, &#8220;Baker, baker, your
bread is burnin&#8217;,&#8221; or &#8220;Bakerie, bakerie, your bread is burnin&#8217;.&#8221;
The guesser answers, &#8220;Will you give a corner of it to me?&#8221;
or &#8220;Give me a corner of it,&#8221; and takes a stand beside the
namer. The namer then says<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, cheese me east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, cheese me west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, cheese me to &#8220;Rose.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The guesser points to one of the players. If the guess is
right, the player goes to the guesser&#8217;s side; if wrong, to the
namer&#8217;s side, when all the players except one are chosen.
This one gets two names, say &#8220;Needles&#8221; and &#8220;Preens.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_448" id="PageII_448">[448]</a></span>
namer then says to the guesser, &#8220;Needles&#8221; or &#8220;Preens&#8221;? A
guess is made. This is done three times, and each time the
names are changed. If the last guess is made correctly, then
the player goes to the guesser, if not, to the namer. Sometimes
it is decided by &#8220;the best o&#8217; three.&#8221; Then comes the
&#8220;tug of war.&#8221; The gaining side calls out &#8220;Rotten eggs,

with the handkerchief, sits down in the centre, and covers her
face with her hands. The one with the handkerchief goes
round again, asking, &#8220;What will you give?&#8221; and the ring
answers. Her name is then given, and the girl with the handkerchief
again asks, &#8220;What will you give to tell <i>his</i> name?&#8221;
The ring answers again, and the sweetheart&#8217;s name is then
given. The girl with the handkerchief goes round again and
sings the last lines, the ring singing with her. Then the one
in the centre joins the ring, and the game begins again.&#8212;Aberdeen

the game and dialogue, if any, may, however, have been similar.
Mr. Rouse says: &#8220;I cannot recollect more of Old Cranny
Crow than that she entices children one by one out for a walk,
and steals them from their supposed mother. The mother is
then invited to dine by Old Cranny Crow, and has a pie (one
of her children) set before her, with pepper and salt, which she
pretends to eat, and when doing so discovers it to be just like
her Tommy (or other child&#8217;s name). Then Cranny Crow
puts another pie before her; this she discovers to be just
like her Katy. She finds out all her children one by one, and
they come to life again and run home.&#8221;&#8212;M. L. Rouse, Blackheath.

<p>Mr. Duncan, when sending me the games he collected, said&#8212;&#8220;It
is very possible that the people may have brought some
of the games from England when returning from harvesting.
This, however, does not apply to &#8216;Old Johanny Hairy, crap in,&#8217;
as it is now called in English. Crap isteach is the Irish for
&#8216;draw in,&#8217; as in Mr. O&#8217;Faharty&#8217;s &#8216;Sports of the Winter&#8217; there
is a Gaelic version. This, I should imagine, makes it certain
that, although well known elsewhere, the game also obtained
in the West of Ireland.&#8221;</p>

<p>One player commences first by winning the toss. The pick
(a small flat stone) is pitched into No. 1 bed. It is then moved
out of this first place, backward across the front line, and not
otherwise by touching or forcing it with one foot, the other
foot being kept up; that is, the player must hop and use the
foot on the ground to strike &#8220;pick.&#8221; No line must be touched.
If this happens, or if the pick, when being driven towards the
pitching line, gets away otherwise than across the front line,
the player is &#8220;out,&#8221; and the next boy goes in. All the beds
are done likewise, and all must be then done in a reverse way,
beginning with No. 10. The first player who completes the
game wins.&#8212;Waterville, Co. Kerry (Mrs. B. B. Green).</p>

<h3><a name="Add_75" id="Add_75"></a>Rashes.</h3>

<p>A game played by children with rushes in Derbyshire, which
is a relic of the old custom of rush-bearing. In the warm days
of May and June the village children proceed in parties to the
sedges and banks of dyke and brook, there to gather the finest
and best rushes. These are brought with childish ceremony
to some favourite spot, and then woven into various articles,
such as baskets, parasols, and umbrellas. Small arbours are
made of green bushes and strewn with rushes, inside which
the children sit and sing and play at &#8220;keeping house&#8221; with
much lordly ceremony. At these times they play at a game
which consists in joining hands in a circle, and going round a
heap of rushes singing or saying<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>At each repetition of the word &#8220;rashes&#8221; (rushes) they loosen
hands, and each picking up a lot of rushes, throw them into
the air, so that they may fall on every one in the descent.
Many of the articles made with rushes are hung over the
chimney-piece in houses, and in children&#8217;s bedrooms, as ornaments
or samples of skill, and there remain until the next
season, or until the general cleaning at Christmas.&#8212;Thomas.

<h2><a name="Memoir" id="Memoir">MEMOIR ON THE STUDY OF
CHILDREN&#8217;S GAMES</a></h2>


<p>Children&#8217;s games have not hitherto been studied in the same
way as customs and superstitions and folk-tales have been
studied, namely, as a definite branch of folk-lore. It is well
however, to bear in mind that they form a branch by themselves,
and that, as such, they contribute to the results which
folk-lore is daily producing towards elucidating many unrecorded
facts in the early history of civilised man.</p>

<p>Although games have been used by Dr. Tylor and others
as anthropological evidence, these authorities have mostly
confined themselves to those games of skill or chance which
happen to have parallels in savage life; and the particular
point of their conclusions rests rather upon the parallels, than
upon the substantive evidence of the games themselves.</p>

<p>I will first point out the nature of the material for the
study. It will be seen that the greater number of games
printed in these two volumes have been collected by myself
and many kind correspondents, from children in the present
day&#8212;games that these children have learned from other
children or from their parents, and in no case, so far as I am
aware, have they been learned from a printed source. To
this collection I have added all printed versions of the traditional
game, that is, versions of games written down by the
collector of folk-lore and dialect&#8212;in some cases unconscious
collectors of folk custom&#8212;from any available source. A distinctive
feature of the collection is, therefore, that I have
printed all versions of each game known to me which show
differences of words or methods of play. The importance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_459" id="PageII_459">[459]</a></span>
having all the principal variants from different parts of the
country will be obvious when definite conclusions as to the
origin and significance of traditional games are being considered.</p>

<p>Strutt mentions many games played by boys in his day,
but his remarks are confined principally to games of skill
with marbles, tops, &amp;c., and games like &#8220;<a href="#GameII_67">Prisoner&#8217;s Base</a>,&#8221;
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_129">Scots and English</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_316">Hot Cockles</a>,&#8221; &amp;c. He records none
of those interesting dialogue games which we know now
as singing games. It may be that these games were in his
day, as now, the property more of girls than of boys, and
he may not have looked for or thought of recording them, for
it can hardly be imagined that he was unaware of their
existence. He records swinging and ball and shuttlecock
playing as girls&#8217; amusements, but very little else, and it cannot
even be suggested that the singing game and dialogue
game have arisen since his time. Indeed, an examination
of the games will, I hope, prove for them a very remote
origin, showing traces of early beliefs and customs which
children could not have invented, and would not have made
the subjects of their play unless those beliefs and customs
were as familiar to them as cabs, omnibuses, motor cars, and
railways, are to the children of to-day, who use these things
as factors in games which they make up.</p>

<p>I do not pretend to have made a complete collection of all
versions of games to be found in the United Kingdom and
Ireland. It will be seen from my list that some counties are
entirely unrepresented; but I think examples enough have been
brought together from a sufficient number of different places
to show that, even could I obtain the games of every county,
I could not reasonably hope to obtain any that would be completely
different from those appearing here. Versions differing,
more or less, in words from these would, doubtless, appear,
but I do not think an entirely different game, or any variants
that would materially alter my conclusions, will now be found.
All those sent me during the progress of the volumes through
the press&#8212;and these are a considerable number&#8212;show no
appreciable differences.</p>

<p>A detailed examination of each game has led me to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_460" id="PageII_460">[460]</a></span>
certain conclusions as to the origin of many of the games.
These conclusions differ materially from those advanced by
Halliwell, Strutt, or the earlier writers, when they have attempted
to suggest the origin of a game. I also differ from
Mr. Newell in many of the conclusions advanced in his admirable
collection of American children&#8217;s games, although I fully
recognise the importance of his method of research. I believe,
too, that hitherto no attention has been paid to the manner or
method in which the game is played. It is to the &#8220;method&#8221;
or &#8220;form&#8221; of play, when taken together with the words, that
I wish to draw particular attention, believing it to be most
important to the history of the games.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, claim that all the games recorded in
these two volumes are traditional in their present form, or have
had independent origins; many of these now known under different
names have a common origin. There is, probably, not one
game in the same condition, especially as regards words, as it
was fifty or a hundred years ago; but I consider the &#8220;form&#8221;
or &#8220;method&#8221; would remain practically the same even if the
words get materially altered.</p>

<p>All games seem primarily to fall into one of two sections:
the first, dramatic games; the second, games of skill and
chance. Now the game proper, according to the general idea,
must contain the element of winning or losing. Thus, the
games of skill and chance are played either for the express
purpose of winning property of some sort from a less fortunate
or skilful player, or to attain individual distinction. Games of
this kind are usually called boys&#8217; games, and are played
principally by them; but beyond these generally recognised
games is the important section of dramatic games, which are
regarded as the property of the girls, and played principally
by them.</p>

<p>These two sections are generally considered as the peculiar
and particular property of each sex. Although this idea is
borne out by a study of the traditional game, it will be found
that the boys have dramatic games of their own, and the girls
have special games of skill and chance. It has so happened,
however, that the development in the case of the boys&#8217; dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_461" id="PageII_461">[461]</a></span>
games has been in the direction of increasing the rules or laws
of a game, introducing thereby so much variety that it is difficult
to recognise them as descendants of the dramatic originals.
This has probably been the result of their use in school playgrounds,
while the girls&#8217; dramatic games, not being utilised as a
means of exercise, have been left alone, and are dying a natural
death.</p>

<p>It will be convenient if, at this point, the games are classified
as I shall use them in discussing the question of origin. The
first necessary classification will relate to the incidents which
show the customs and rites from which the games have descended;
the second classification will relate to the dramatic
force of the games, as it is from this that I hope to construct
the ladder by which the game can be shown to have descended
from a long past stage of culture.</p>

<p>The classification, according to incident, is as follows,
the name of each game referring to the title-name in the
dictionary:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>In order to show the importance of this classification, let me
first refer to the games of skill. These are (1) where one
individual plays with some articles belonging to himself against<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_471" id="PageII_471">[471]</a></span>
several other players who play with corresponding articles
belonging to them; (2) where one player attempts to gain
articles deposited beforehand by all the players as stakes or
objects to be played for. These games are played with buttons,
marbles, cherry-stones, nuts, pins, and pence. In the second
group, each player stakes one or more of these articles before
beginning play, which stakes become the property of the
winner of the game. The object of some of the games in the
first group is the destruction of the article with which the
opponent plays. This is the case with the games of &#8220;conkers&#8221;
played with nuts on a string, and peg-top; the nuts and top
are broken, if possible, by the players, to prevent their being
used again, the peg of the top being retained by the winner
as a trophy. The successful nut or top has the merit and
glory of having destroyed previously successful nuts or tops.
The victories of the one destroyed are tacked on and appropriated
by each victor in succession. So we see a nut or a top
which has destroyed another having a record of, say, twenty-five
victories, taking these twenty-five victories of its opponent
and adding them to its own score. In like manner the pegs
of the tops slain in peg-top are preserved and shown as
trophies. That the destruction of the implements of the
game, although not adding to the immediate wealth of the
winner, does materially increase his importance, is manifest,
especially in the days when these articles were comparatively
much more expensive than now, or when it meant, as
at one time it must have done, the making of another
implement.</p>

<p>These games are of interest to the folk-lorist, as showing
connection with early custom. We know that playing at
games for stakes involving life or death to the winner, or the
possession of the loser&#8217;s magical or valuable property or knowledge,
is not only found in another branch of folk-lore, namely,
folk-tales, but there is plenty of evidence of the early belief
that the possession of a weapon which had, in the hands of a
skilful chief, done great execution, would give additional skill
and power to the person who succeeded in obtaining it. When
I hear of a successful &#8220;conker&#8221; or top being preserved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_472" id="PageII_472">[472]</a></span>
handed down from father to son,<a name="FNanchor2_19" id="FNanchor2_19"></a><a href="#Footnote2_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and exhibited with tales of
its former victories, I believe we have survivals of the form of
transmission of virtues from one person to another through the
means of an acquired object. I do not think that the cumulative
reckoning and its accompanying ideas would occur to
modern boys, unless they had inherited the conception of the
virtue of a conquered enemy&#8217;s weapon being transferred to the
conqueror&#8217;s.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote2_19" id="Footnote2_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> I know of one nut which was preserved and shown to admiring boys as a
conqueror of 1000.</p>

</div>

<p>Other games of skill are those played by two or more
players on diagrams or plans. Many of these diagrams and
plans are found scratched or carved on the stone flooring or
walls of old churches, cathedrals, and monastic buildings,
showing that the boys and men of the Middle Ages played them
as a regular amusement&#8212;probably monks were not averse to
this kind of diversion in the intervals of religious exercise;
plans were also made on the ground, and the games played
regularly by shepherds and other people of outdoor occupation.
We know this was so with the well-known &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_439">Nine
Men&#8217;s Morris</a>&#8221; in Shakespeare&#8217;s time, and there is no reason
why this should not be the case with others, although &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_439">Nine
Men&#8217;s Morris</a>&#8221; appears to have been the favourite. These
diagram games are primitive in idea, and simple in form.
They consist primarily of two players trying to form a row
of three stones in three consecutive places on the plan; the
one who first accomplishes this, wins. This is the case with
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_370">Kit-Cat-Cannio</a>&#8221; (better known as &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_443">Noughts and Crosses</a>&#8221;)
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_158">Corsicrown</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_439">Nine Men&#8217;s Morris</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, in &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_443">Noughts and Crosses</a>&#8221; the simplest form of making
a &#8220;row of three,&#8221; where only two players play, and in another
diagram game called &#8220;<a href="#GameII_219">Tit-Tat-Toe</a>,&#8221; it is possible for neither
player to win, and in this case the result is marked or scored
to an unknown or invisible third player, who is called &#8220;Old
Nick,&#8221; &#8220;Old Tom,&#8221; or &#8220;Old Harry.&#8221; In some versions this
third player is allowed to keep all the marks he registers, and
to win the game if possible; in others, the next successful
player takes &#8220;Old Nick&#8217;s&#8221; score and adds it to his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_473" id="PageII_473">[473]</a></span>
Here we have an element which needs explanation, and it is
interesting to remind oneself of the primitive custom of assigning
a certain proportion of the crops or pieces of land to
the devil, or other earth spirit, which assignment was made
by lot. It seems to me that a game in which an invisible
player takes part must come from an era in which unknown
spirits were believed to take part in people&#8217;s lives,
the interpretation of such part being obtained by means of
divination.</p>

<p>Again, in the games played with ball (hand) are remains of
divination, and the ball games played by two opposite parties
with bats and sticks, the origin of our modern cricket and
football, have been developed from those early contests
which have played such an important part in parish and
town politics. Even in the simple game of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_224">Touch</a>&#8221; or
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_211">Tig</a>&#8221; a primitive element can be found. In this game,
as in many others, it is one of the fundamental rules, now
unfortunately being disregarded, that the player who is
&#8220;he&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8221; must be chosen by lot; one of the &#8220;counting
out&#8221; rhymes is said until all the players but one are counted
out&#8212;this one is then &#8220;he.&#8221; This &#8220;he&#8221; is apparently a
&#8220;tabooed&#8221; person; he remains &#8220;he&#8221; until he succeeds in
touching another, who becomes &#8220;tabooed&#8221; in turn, and the
first is then restored to his own personality. There would be
no necessity for this deciding by lot unless something of an
ignominious or &#8220;evil&#8221; character had been originally associated
with the &#8220;unnamed&#8221; or &#8220;tabooed&#8221; player. In some games the
player who is counted out is the victim of the rough play or
punishment, which is the motive of the game. It is possible
that the game of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_224">Touch</a>&#8221; has developed from the practice of
choosing a victim by lot, or from tabooing people suffering
from certain diseases or subjected to some special punishment.</p>

<p>The &#8220;counting out&#8221; rhymes of children are in themselves
an interesting and curious study. They contain the remains
in distorted form of some of the early numerals. The fact
of a counting-out rhyme being used in the games is of itself
evidence of antiquity and old usage. For those interested
in this branch of study I can refer to the valuable book on<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_474" id="PageII_474">[474]</a></span>
this subject by Mr. H. Carrington Bolton, which contains
hundreds of these rhymes collected from various sources.</p>

<p>I mention these instances of possible connection between the
games of skill and ancient belief and custom, to show that the
anthropological significance of traditional games is not absent
from what might perhaps be considered quite modern games.
This is important to my argument, because when I turn to the
dramatic section of children&#8217;s games there is so much evidence
of the survival of ancient custom and belief, that I am supported
in the arguments which I shall advance by the fact that the
whole province of children&#8217;s play, and not particular departments,
contribute to this evidence. It will be seen from the
classification that many customs are dramatised or represented
in a more or less imperfect form in a large number of games,
and that these customs have been those which obtained a firm
hold on the people, and formed an integral part of their daily
life. Courtship, love, and marriage form the largest number;
then the contest games for the taking of prisoners and of
territory are the next in point of numbers. Funerals appear
as the next most widely spread, then harvest customs, while
the practice of divination, the belief in ghosts and charms,
well-worship, tree-worship, and rush-bearing, witches, and
child-stealing, are fully represented. Next come imitations of
sports (animal), and contest games between animals, and then
a number of games in which &#8220;guessing&#8221; is a principal feature,
and a large number dealing with penalties or punishments
inflicted for breach of rules.</p>

<p>A survey of the classification scheme of traditional games
introduces the important fact that games contain customs; in
other words, that games of skill and chance have come down
from a time when practices were in vogue which had nothing
originally to do with games, and that dramatic games have
come down from times when the action they dramatise was
the contemporary action of the people. It becomes important,
therefore, to work more closely into the details of these games,
to ascertain if we can what customs are preserved, to what
people or period of culture they might have belonged. In
many instances enough is said under each game to show the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_475" id="PageII_475">[475]</a></span>
significance of the conclusions, but when brought together and
compared one with another these conclusions become more
significant. The fact that marriage custom is preserved in a
given form becomes of immense value when it is found to have
been preserved in many games. I shall not go further into the
games of skill and chance, but confine myself to the important
class of dramatic games.</p>

<p>By the dramatic game I mean a play or amusement which
consists of words sung or said by the players, accompanied by
certain pantomimic actions which accord with the words used,
or, as I prefer to put it, of certain definite and settled actions
performed by the players to indicate certain meanings, of
which the words are only a further illustration.</p>

<p>To take the method of play first, I have found five distinct
and different methods:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>(1) The line form of game, played by the children being
divided into two sides of about an equal number on each side,
with a space of ground of about eight or ten feet between the
two lines. Each line joins hands, and advances and retires in
turn while singing or saying their parts.</p>

<p>(2) The circle form, played by the children joining hands
and forming a circle, and all walking or dancing round together
when singing the words.</p>

<p>(3) The individual form, where the children take separate
characters and act a little play.</p>

<p>(4) The arch form, in which two children clasp each other&#8217;s
hands, hold their arms high, and so form a kind of arch,
beneath which all the other players run in single file.</p>

<p>(5) Winding-up form, in which the players, clasping hands,
wind round another player until all are wedged closely together,
and then unwind again, generally assuming a serpentine
form in so doing.</p>

<p>It will be well, in the first place, to arrange the games
played under each of these methods:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The first or line form of games is characterised by no one
player being distinguished above his fellows; there are no distinct
or separate characters to be played. All the players on
one line say the same words and perform the same actions; all
advance together and retire together. Each line stands still
while the other line advances, retires, and has its &#8220;say.&#8221; In
this way questions are asked and answers are given. Questions
and answers form an essential part of the line form of
game. The one line of players imply action of a party composed
of several persons who are of the same opinion, and the
line on the opposite side is a party who hold different opinions,
and express these in words and by actions; so that in no
game played in line form do we get unanimous action of all the
players, but half and half.</p>

<p>These line games represent in the main a contest, and there
are contests of different kinds; that is, war between the
people of two different locations, between parishes or border
countries of different nationalities, and contests for wives, of a
more or less friendly nature. That the lines or sides indicate
people who come from one country or district to another country
or district is shown, I think, by the fact that a line is drawn in
the middle of the ground, which line separates the territory of
the two sides. Players can go as far as the line on their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_478" id="PageII_478">[478]</a></span>
side, but one step over lands them in the enemy&#8217;s territory.
In a marriage game of the line form, the girl when unwilling is
pulled across the line, and when willing she walks across to
the opposite side. It is also clear that in the marriage games
the party on one side represents young men, and on the other
side young women.</p>

<p>In the second group, the circle form, all the players join
hands to form a circle. They all perform the same actions and
say the same words. This circle form is used in three ways.</p>

<p>In the first or simplest class all the players perform the same
actions, sing the same words all together. There is no division
into parties, and no individual action or predominance. This
method is adopted when a certain recurring custom is celebrated
or a special event is commemorated. The event is
described in pantomimic action, and accompanied with dance
and song.</p>

<p>In the second class the circle is formed, the players all clasp
hands, dance round together, and sing the same words; but
the action is confined to first one and then two players, who
are taken by &#8220;choice&#8221; from those forming the circle. This
class principally consists of courtship, love-making, and marriage
games. The two principal parties concerned usually
have no words to say, though in some &#8220;love&#8221; games the
centre player does express his or her own feelings in verse.
The fact that this form is used for love and marriage games
accounts for the much larger number of games in this class
and their greater variety.</p>

<p>In the third class of the circle game the players form the
circle to act the part of &#8220;chorus&#8221; to the story. There are also
two, three, or four players, as required, who act parts in dumb
show suitable to the character personified. In this class the
circle personate both animate and inanimate objects. The
circle is stationary&#8212;at least the players forming it do not dance
or walk round. They sometimes represent houses; a village,
and animals are usually represented rather than people.</p>

<p>The circle games I consider to be survivals of dramatic
representations of customs performed by people of one village
or of one town or tribe&#8212;representations of social customs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_479" id="PageII_479">[479]</a></span>
one place or people, as distinct from the &#8220;line&#8221; form of games,
which represent a custom obtaining between two rival villages
or tribes. Thus I am inclined to consider the joining of hands
in a circle as a sign of amity, alliance, and kinship. In the case
of the line games hands are clasped by all players on each side,
who are thus in alliance against those on the opposite side.
When hands are joined all round so that a circle is formed, all
are concerned in the performance of the same ceremony. There
is no division into parties, neither is difference of opinion shown
either by action or words in circle games.</p>

<p>In the third class of game there are several distinct characters,
and the game partakes more of the nature of what we
should call a play proper, and may be considered an outcome
of the circle play. There are several characters, usually a
mother, a witch or old woman, an elder daughter and several
younger children, a ghost, and sometimes animals, such as
sheep, wolves, fox, hen, and chickens. The principal characters
(not more than two or three) are played by different children,
and these having each a part allotted to them, have also a
certain amount of dialogue to say, and corresponding actions
to perform. The remaining characters, whether children or
animals, merely act their part when action is required, all doing
the same thing, and have no words to say. The dialogue in
these games is short and to the point. It has not been learnt
from written sources, but orally, and as long as the main idea
and principal incidents are not departed from, the players may,
according to their capacity, add to or shorten the dialogue to
heighten the situation. There is no singing in these games,
though there is what perhaps might be called the remains of
rhyme in the dialogue.</p>

<p>The fourth form, that of the arch, is played in two ways. In
the first, two children clasp their hands and hold them up to
form an arch. Under this all the other players run as if
going through an arch or gateway, and the players are generally
stopped by the two who form the arch. Then a circle
is formed, and all the players join hands and dance round
together. In the second way, the arch is formed as above,
and all the players run under. These players are then caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_480" id="PageII_480">[480]</a></span>
one by one within the arch, and have to choose one of the two
leaders, behind whom they stand. A tug-of-war then ensues
between the two leaders and their followers.</p>

<p>The first of these, that ending with the circle or dancing,
indicates the celebration of an event in which all the people
join, and all are of one way of thinking&#8212;differing from this
group of customs celebrated by the simple circle game by each
person in turn performing a ceremony, signified in games by
the action of going under or through an arch.</p>

<p>The second way, when the &#8220;tug&#8221; follows, represents a contest,
but I do not think the contest is of the same kind as that
of the line form. This rather represents the leaders of two
parties who are antagonistic, who call, in the words of the
rhymes, upon the people of a town, or faction, to join one of
the two sides. The fact that each player in the line or string
is caught by the leaders, and has to choose which of them
he will fight under, together with the tug or pulling of one
side over a marked line, by the other side, indicates a difference
in the kind of warfare from the line contests, where
territory is clearly the cause of the struggle and fight. The
line contest shows a fight between people of different lands;
and the arch contest, a method of choosing leaders by people
living in one land or town.</p>

<p>In the fifth form, &#8220;winding up games,&#8221; the players join
hands in a long line, and wind round and round one player
at the end of the line, usually the tallest, who stands still
until all are formed in a number of circles, something like
a watch spring. They then unwind, sometimes running or
dancing, in a serpentine fashion until all are again in straight
line. These games probably refer to the custom of encircling
trees, as an act of worship. They differ from the circle game
in this way: The players in a circle game surround something
or some one. In the &#8220;winding up&#8221; game they not only
surround, but attachment or &#8220;hold&#8221; to the thing surrounded
has to be kept.</p>

<p>The fact that these games lend themselves to such treatment,
and the fact that I am obliged to use the terms, district, tribe,
localities, obliged to speak of a state of contest between groups,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_481" id="PageII_481">[481]</a></span>
of the sacred encircling of a tree, and of other significant usages,
go far to suggest that these games must contain some element
which belongs to the essential part of their form, and my next
quest is for this element. I shall take each class of game, and
endeavour to ascertain what element is present which does
not necessarily belong to games, or which belongs to other and
more important branches of human action; and it will depend
on what this element is as to what can ultimately be said of
the origin of the games.</p>

<p>Of the games played in &#8220;line&#8221; form, &#8220;<a href="#GameII_260">We are the Rovers</a>&#8221;
is the best representative of pure contest between two opposing
parties. If reference is made to the game (<a href="#PageII_343">vol. ii. pp. 343-356</a>),
the words will be found to be very significant. In my account
of the game (<a href="#PageII_356">pp. 356-60</a>), I suggest that it owes its origin
to the Border warfare which existed on the Marches between
England and Scotland and England and Wales, and I give my
reasons, from analysing the game, why I consider it represents
this particular form of contest rather than that of a fight
between two independent countries. Both sides advancing
and retiring in turn, while shouting their mutual defiance, and
the final fight, which continues until all of one side are
knocked down or captured, show that a deliberate fight was
intended to be shown. I draw attention, too, to the war-cry
used by each side, which is also significant of one of the old
methods of rallying the men to the side of their leader&#8212;an
especially necessary thing in undisciplined warfare. This game,
then, contains relics of ancient social conditions. That such a
contest game as this is represented by the line form combining
words, singing, and action, is, I submit, good evidence of my
contention that the line form of game denotes contest. This
game, then, I consider a traditional type of contest game.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that among the ordinary, now somewhat
old-fashioned, contest games played by boys there should be
some which, I think, are degenerate descendants of this traditional
type. There are a number of boys&#8217; games, the chief
features of which are catching and taking prisoners and getting
possession of an enemy&#8217;s territory&#8212;as in the well-known
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_67">Prisoner&#8217;s Base</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#GameII_129">Scots and English</a>.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_482" id="PageII_482">[482]</a></span>&#8217;s
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_67">Prisoner Base</a>&#8221; (ii. pp. 80-87) in its present form does not appear to
have much in common with games of the type of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_260">We are the
Rovers</a>,&#8221; but on turning to Strutt we find an earlier way of
playing (<a href="#PageII_80"><i>ibid.</i> p. 80</a>). Now, this description by Strutt gives us
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_67">Prisoner&#8217;s Base</a>&#8221; played by two lines of players, each line
joining hands, their homes or bases being at a distance of
twenty to thirty feet apart. That the line of players had to
keep to their own ground is, I think, manifest, from it being
necessary for one of the line to touch the base. There is no
mention of a leader. Thus we have here an undoubted form
of a contest game, where the taking of prisoners is the avowed
motive, played in almost the same manner as the line dramatic
game. When the dramatic representation of a contest became
formulated in a definite game, the individual running out and
capturing a certain player on the opposite side would soon
develop and become a rule of the game, instead of all on one
side trying to knock down all on the other side. It may be a
point to remember, too, that in primitive warfare the object is
to knock down and kill as many of the enemy as possible,
rather than the capture of prisoners.</p>

<p>In other games of a similar kind, the well-known &#8220;<a href="#GameII_129">Scots and
English</a>&#8221; (ii. p. 183), for example, we have the ground divided
into two parts, with a real or imaginary line drawn in the
middle; the players rush across the line and try to drag one
of the opposite side across it, or to capture the clothes of the
players.</p>

<p>In other boys&#8217; games&#8212;&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_382">Lamploo</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_88">Rax</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_362">King of Cantland</a>,&#8221;
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_360">King C&aelig;sar</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_170">Stag</a>&#8221;&#8212;there are the two sides; the
players are sometimes all on one side, and they have to rush
across to the other, or there are some players on each side,
who rush across to the opposite, trying to avoid being taken
prisoner by a player who stands in the middle between the
opposite goals. When this player catches a boy, that boy
joins hands with him; the next prisoner taken also joins
hands, and these assist in capturing others. This is continued
until all the players are caught and have joined
hands in a long line, practically reverting to the line form
of game, and showing, according to my theory of the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_483" id="PageII_483">[483]</a></span>
game, that all joining hands are of one side or party. If
the line gets broken the players can run back to their own
side. There are many other games which are played in a
similar way (see Contest Games), though farther removed from
the original form. In most of these we have practically the
same thing&#8212;the sides have opposite homes, and the leader,
though individual at first, becomes merged in the group when
the line is formed, and the game ends by all the players being
on one side. It must be mentioned, too, that in these boys&#8217;
games of fighting, the significant custom of &#8220;crowning,&#8221; that
is, touching the head of the captured one, obtains. If this is
omitted the prisoner is at liberty to escape (see &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_140">Cock</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_362">King
of Cantland</a>&#8221;).</p>

<p>Although there is no dialogue between the opposing parties
in these contest games, there are in some versions undoubted
remains of it, now reduced to a few merely formal words
called a &#8220;nominy.&#8221; These &#8220;nominys&#8221; must be said before
the actual fight begins, and the remains are sufficient to
show that the nominy was originally a defiance uttered by
one side and answered by the other. For these nominys,
see &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_54">Blackthorn</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_121">Chickidy Hand</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_325">Hunt the Staigie</a>,&#8221;
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_129">Scots and English</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_348">Johnny Rover</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_138">Shepherds</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_170">Stag</a>,&#8221;
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_258">Warney</a>,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>The next most important games in line form are marriage
games. In the well-known &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_445">Nuts in May</a>&#8221; (vol. i. p. 424-433)
there is a contest between the two parties, but the
contest here is to obtain an individual for the benefit of the
side. A line is drawn on the ground and a player is deliberately
sent to &#8220;fetch&#8221; another player from the opposite side,
and that this player is expected to conquer is shown by
the fact that he is selected for this purpose, and also because
the ceremony of &#8220;crowning&#8221; prevails in some versions. The
boy, after he has pulled the girl across the line, places his hand
on her head to complete the capture and to make a prisoner.
This custom of &#8220;crowning&#8221; prevails in many games where prisoners
are made, and I have already mentioned it as occurring in
the boys&#8217; contest games. If the crowning is performed, the
capture is complete; if not performed, the prisoner may escape.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_484" id="PageII_484">[484]</a></p>

<p>The evidence of this game, I consider, points to customs
which belong to the ancient form of marriage, and to what is
technically known as marriage by capture.</p>

<p>In the game of the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>&#8221; (vol. ii. p. 233-255), it
will be noticed that the actions are very spirited. Coquetry,
contempt, and annoyance are all expressed in action, and
the boys imitate riding and the prancing of horses. I
must draw special attention to the remarks I have made
in my account of the game, and for convenience in comparing
the line marriage games I will repeat shortly the
principal points here.</p>

<p>In some versions, the three dukes each choose a wife at the
same time, and when these three are &#8220;wived&#8221; or &#8220;paired&#8221;
another three do the same. In another version &#8220;five&#8221; dukes
each choose a wife, and all five couples dance round together.
But most significant of all is the action of the dukes after
selecting the girl, trying to carry her off, and her side trying
to prevent it.</p>

<p>In this game, then, I think we have a distinct survival of
or remembrance of the tribal marriage&#8212;marriage at a period
when it was the custom for the men of a clan or village to seek
wives from the girls of another clan&#8212;both belonging to one
tribe. The game is a marriage game of the most matter-of-fact
kind. Young men arrive from a place at some distance
for the purpose of seeking wives. The maidens are apparently
ready and expecting their arrival. They are as willing to
become wives as the men are to become husbands. It is not
marriage by force or capture, though the triumphant carrying
off of a wife appears. It is exogamous marriage custom.
The suggested depreciation of the girls, and their saucy
rejoinders, are so much good-humoured chaff and banter
exchanged to enhance each other&#8217;s value. There is no mention
of &#8220;love&#8221; in the game, nor courtship between the boy and girl.
The marriage formula does not appear, nor is there any sign
that a &#8220;ceremony&#8221; or &#8220;sanction&#8221; to marry is necessary, nor
does &#8220;kissing&#8221; occur. Another interesting point about this
game is the refrain, &#8220;With a rancy, tancy, tee,&#8221; which refrain,
or something similar, accompanies all verses of all versions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_485" id="PageII_485">[485]</a></span>
and separates this game from others akin to it. This refrain
is doubtless a survival of an old tribal war-cry.</p>

<p>The game of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_202">The Three Knights from Spain</a>&#8221; (ii. pp. 257-279),
played in the same way as &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>,&#8221; may appear
at first to be a variant of the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>&#8221;; but it is significant
that the form of marriage custom is different, though
it is still marriage under primitive conditions of society. The
personal element, entirely absent from the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>,&#8221;
is here one of the principal characteristics. The marriage is
still one without previous courtship or love between two
individuals, but the parental element is present here, or, at
any rate, if not parental, there is that of some authority, and
a sanction to marry is given, although there is no trace of
any actual ceremony. The young men apparently desire
some particular person in marriage, and a demand is made
for her. The suitors here are, I think, making a demand
on the part of another rather than for themselves. They
may be the ambassadors or friends of the would-be bridegroom,
and are soliciting for a marriage in which purchase-money
or dowry is to be paid. The mention of &#8220;gold&#8221; and
&#8220;silver&#8221; and the line, &#8220;She must be sold,&#8221; and the offering
of presents by the &#8220;Knights,&#8221; are important. These indications
of purchase refer to a time when the custom of offering
gold, money, and other valuables for a bride was in vogue.
While, therefore, the game has traces of capturing or carrying
off the bride, this carrying off is in strict accord with the conditions
prevalent when marriage by purchase had succeeded
to marriage by capture. There is evidence in this game of a
mercantile spirit, which suggests that women and girls were
too valuable to be parted with by their own tribe or family
without something deemed an equivalent in return.</p>

<p>In another line game, &#8220;<a href="#GameII_205">Here comes Three Sailors</a>&#8221; (ii.
pp. 282-289), there is still more evidence of the mercantile or
bargaining spirit. Here the representative of the parental
element or other authority selects the richest and highest in
rank of the suitors, and a sum of money is given with the bride.
The suitors are supposed to have performed some actions which
have gained them renown and entitled them to a wife. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_486" id="PageII_486">[486]</a></span>
suitors are accepted or rejected by a person having authority,
and this authority introduces an interesting and suggestive
feature. The suitors are invited to stay or lodge in the house
if accepted, probably meaning admission into the family. The
girl is to &#8220;wake up,&#8221; and not sleep, that is, to rouse up, be
merry, dress in bridal array, and prepare for the coming
festival. She is given to the suitors with &#8220;in her pocket
one hundred pounds,&#8221; and &#8220;on her finger a gay gold ring.&#8221;
This is given by the &#8220;mother&#8221; or those having authority,
and refers, I believe, to the property the girl takes with her
to her new abode for her proper maintenance there; the ring
shows her station and degree, and is a token that she is a fit
bride for a &#8220;king.&#8221; Curious, too, is the &#8220;Here&#8217;s my daughter
safe and sound,&#8221; which looks like a warrant or guarantee of
the girl&#8217;s fitness to be a bride, and the robbery of the bride
may also have originally related to the removal of the bride&#8217;s
wedding-dress or ornaments before she enters on her wifely
duties.</p>

<p>Following these definite marriage games in line form, in
which previous love or courtship does not appear, we have
several games formerly played at weddings, practically as a
part of the necessary amusement to be gone through after a
marriage ceremony by the company present, amusements in
which are the traces of earlier custom.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_14">Babbity Bowster</a>&#8221; (i. pp. 9-11) is an old Scottish dance or
game which used to be played as the last dance at weddings
and merrymakings. It was danced by two lines of players,
lads on one side, girls on the other. A lad took a handkerchief&#8212;in
earlier times a bolster or pillow&#8212;and danced out
in front of the girls, singing. He then selected a girl, threw
the handkerchief into her lap or round her neck, holding both
ends himself, and placed the handkerchief at her feet on the
floor. His object was to obtain a kiss. This was not given
without a struggle, and the line of girls cheered their companion
at every unsuccessful attempt the boy made. When
a girl took the handkerchief she threw it to a boy, who had
to run after and catch her and then attempt to take a kiss.
When all had done thus they danced in line form. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_487" id="PageII_487">[487]</a></span>
dance took place at the time when bride and bridegroom
retired to the nuptial chamber. It is probable the bride and
bridegroom would first go through the dance, and after the
bridegroom had caught his bride and they had retired the
dance would be continued in sport. The chasing of the bride
in sport by her new-made husband at the close of the marriage
festivities is mentioned in old ballads.</p>

<p>In the &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_177">Cushion Dance</a>&#8221; (i. pp. 87-94) we have an instance
of another similar old English game sang and danced at
weddings. The &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_177">Cushion Dance</a>,&#8221; though not played in line
form, has two other elements of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_14">Babbity Bowster</a>.&#8221; The
description is so interesting, I will repeat it shortly here. The
company were all seated. Two young men left the room,
and returned carrying, one a square cushion, the other a
drinking horn or silver tankard. The young man carrying
the cushion locked the door, taking the key. The young men
then danced round the room to a lively tune played by a
fiddler, and sang the words of the dance. There is a short
dialogue with the fiddler, in which it is announced that &#8220;Jane
Sandars won&#8217;t come to.&#8221; The fiddler says &#8220;She must come,
whether she will or no.&#8221; The young men then dance round
again and choose a young woman, before whom they place
the cushion and offer the horn or cup. The girl and the
young man kneel on the cushion and kiss. Here there is
no capturing or chasing of the girl, but her reluctance to be
brought to the cushion is stated by another person, and the
locking of the door is evidently done to prevent escape of the
girls.</p>

<p>Other line games contain the element of courting, some
versions of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_250">Green Grass</a>,&#8221; for instance (i. pp. 161-62),
show boys on one line, girls on the other, inviting girls to
come and dance, and promising them gifts. After the boys
have selected a girl, she is asked if she will come. She
replies first No! then Yes! &#8220;<a href="#GameII_58">Pray, Pretty Miss</a>,&#8221; is similar to
these (vol. ii. pp. 65-67).</p>

<p>The remaining line form of marriage games are probably
degenerate versions of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_198">Three Dukes</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_202">Three Knights</a>,&#8221;
except &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_273">Here Comes a Lusty Wooer</a>&#8221; (i. 202) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_488" id="PageII_488">[488]</a></span>
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_350">Jolly Hooper</a>&#8221; (i. 287-88). Ritson records the first of these two
in &#8220;Gammer Gurton&#8217;s Garland,&#8221; 1783; the second is probably
a degenerate version of the first or similar version. They
are both demands for a bride.</p>

<p>The other important line games are &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_338">Jenny Jones</a>&#8221; (i. 260-283),
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_377">Lady of the Land</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#GameII_80">Queen Anne</a>.&#8221; I refer here
to the Scotch version of &#8220;Jenny Jones,&#8221; quoted from Chambers,
given in vol. i. p. 281, where &#8220;Janet Jo&#8221; is a dramatic entertainment
amongst young rustics. Two of the party represent
a goodman and a goodwife, the rest a family of daughters.
One of the lads, the best singer, enters, demands to court
Janet Jo. He is asked by the goodwife what he will give for
Janet Jo. His offers of a peck o&#8217; siller, a peck of gold, are
refused; he offers more and is accepted, and told to sit beside
his chosen one. He then has a scramble with her for kisses.
Versions of this game which indicate funeral customs will be
treated under that head; but love and courtship appear in the
game, and the courting appears to be that of a young man
or young men, to whom objection is made, pretended or
real; the suitors are evidently objects of suspicion to the
parental authority, and their sincerity is tested by the offers
they make.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<a href="#GameII_80">Queen Anne</a>,&#8221; vol. ii. pp. 90-102, I have attempted a
conjectural rendering of what the game might have been, by
putting together the words of different versions. If this conjectural
restoration be accepted as something near the original
form, it would suggest that this game originated from one of the
not uncommon customs practised at weddings and betrothals,
where the suitor has to discriminate between several girls all
dressed exactly alike, and to distinguish his bride by some token.
This incident of actual primitive custom also obtains in folk-tales,
showing its strong hold on popular tradition. Many a lost
bride in the folk-tales proves her identity by having possession
of some article previously given as a token, and this idea may
account for the &#8220;ball&#8221; incident in this game. (See also &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_365">King
William</a>.&#8221;)</p>

<p>From these games, when thus taken together, we have
evidence of the existence of customs obtaining in primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_489" id="PageII_489">[489]</a></span>
marriage, and the fact that these customs, namely, those of
marriage by capture, marriage by purchase, marriage by
consent of others than those principally concerned, in other
words, marriage between comparative strangers, occur in
games played in line form, a form used for contest and fighting
games, tends to show that the line form is used for the
purpose of indicating the performance of customs which are
supposed to take place between people living in different
countries, towns, and villages, or people of different tribes or of
different habits and customs. The more imperfect games of
this type, though they have lost some of the vigour, have
still enough left to show, when placed with the others, a connection
with customs performed in the same manner.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_377">Lady of the Land</a>,&#8221; for instance (vol. i. pp. 313-20), the
words indicate a lady hiring a poorer woman&#8217;s daughters as
servants, and, no doubt, originates from the country practice of
hiring servants at fairs, or from hirings being dramatically acted
at Harvest Homes. The old practice of hirings at fairs is
distinctly to be traced in local customs (see p. 319), and is a
common incident in folk-tales. In this game, too, actions
would be performed suitable to the work the players undertake
to do.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to mention in detail any of the remaining
line games, because they are fragmentary in form,
and do not add any further evidence to that already
stated.</p>

<p>In considering this group of games it is obvious, I think,
that we have elements of custom and usage which would not
primarily originate in a game, but in a condition of local or
tribal life which has long since passed away. It is a life of
contest, a life, therefore, which existed before the days of
settled politics, when villages or tribal territories had their
own customs differing from each other, and when not only
matters of political relationship were settled by the arbitrament
of the sword, but matters now considered to be of purely
personal relationship, namely, marriage. While great interest
gathers round the particular marriage customs or particular
contests indicated in this group of games, the chief point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_490" id="PageII_490">[490]</a></span>
interest lies in the fact that they are all governed by the
common element of contest.</p>

<p>I will now turn to the circle games. Like the line games,
this form contains games which show marriage custom, but
it is significant that they all show a distinctly different form of
marriage. Thus they all show courtship and love preceding
the marriage, and they show that a distinct ceremony of
marriage is needful; but this ceremony is not necessarily the
present Church ceremony. The two best examples are &#8220;<a href="#GameII_120">Sally
Water</a>&#8221; (vol. ii. pp. 149-179) and &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_415">Merry-ma-tansa</a>&#8221; (vol. i.
pp. 369-367).</p>

<p>In &#8220;<a href="#GameII_120">Sally Water</a>&#8221; the two principal characters have no
words to say, but one chooses another deliberately, and the
bond is sealed by a kiss, and in some instances with joining
of hands. The circle of friends approve the choice, and a
blessing and good wishes follow for the happiness of the
married couple, wishes that children may be born to them,
and the period of the duration of the marriage for seven years
(the popular notion of the time for which the marriage vows
are binding). I have printed a great many versions of this
game (about fifty), and note that in the majority of them
&#8220;Sally&#8221; and &#8220;Water&#8221; are conspicuous words. In fact they
are usually taken to mean the name of the girl, but on examining
the game closely I think it is possible, and probable, that
&#8220;Sally Water&#8221; may be a corruption of some other word or
words, not the name of a girl; that the word &#8220;Water&#8221; is
connected, not with the name of the maiden, but with the
action of sprinkling which she is called upon to fulfil. The
mention of water is pretty constant throughout the game.
There are numerous instances of the corruption of words in
the game, and the tendency has been to lose the sprinkling of
water incident altogether.</p>

<p>The sitting or kneeling attitude, which indicates a reverential
attitude, obtains in nearly all versions, as do the words &#8220;Rise
and choose a young man,&#8221; and &#8220;Crying for a young man.&#8221;
This &#8220;crying&#8221; for a young man does not necessarily mean
weeping; rather I consider it to mean &#8220;announcing a want&#8221;
in the way &#8220;wants&#8221; or &#8220;losses&#8221; were cried formerly by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_491" id="PageII_491">[491]</a></span>
official crier of a town, and in the same manner as in games
children &#8220;cry&#8221; forfeits; but, losing this meaning in this game,
children have substituted &#8220;weeping,&#8221; especially as &#8220;weeping&#8221;
with them expresses many &#8220;wants&#8221; or &#8220;woes.&#8221; The incident
of &#8220;crying&#8221; for a lover, in the sense of wanting a lover, appears
in several of these games. I have heard the expression they&#8217;ve
been &#8220;cried in church&#8221; used as meaning the banns have
been read. The choosing is sometimes &#8220;to the east&#8221; and
&#8220;to the west,&#8221; instead of &#8220;for the best and worst.&#8221; Now,
the expression &#8220;for better for worse&#8221; is an old marriage
formula preserved in the vernacular portion of the ancient
English Marriage Service, and I think we have the same
formula in this game, especially as the final admonition is to
choose the &#8220;one loved best.&#8221; Then comes the very general
lines of the marriage formula occurring so frequently in these
games, &#8220;Now you&#8217;re married, we wish you joy,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_415">Merry-ma-tansa</a>&#8221; the game again consists of a
marriage ceremony, with fuller details. The choice of the
girl is announced to the assembled circle of friends by a
third person, and the friends announce their approval or
disapproval. If they disapprove, another choice is made.
When they approve, the marriage formula is repeated, and
the capacity of the bride to undertake housewifely duties
is questioned in verse by the friends (p. 370). All the circle
then perform actions imitating sweeping and dusting a house,
baking and brewing, shaping and sewing. The marriage
formula is sung, and prognostications and wishes for the
birth of children are followed by actions denoting the nursing
of a baby and going to church, probably for a christening.
In one version, too, the bride is lifted into the circle by two
of the players. This may indicate the carrying of the bride
into her new home, or the lifting of the bride across the
threshold, a well-known custom. In <a href="#Add_62">another version</a> (Addenda,
p. 444) after the ceremony the bridegroom is blindfolded
and has to catch his bride.</p>

<p>These two games relate undoubtedly to marriage customs,
and to no other ceremony or practice. They are, so to speak,
the type forms to which others will assimilate.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_492" id="PageII_492">[492]</a></p>

<p>In &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_332">Isabella</a>&#8221; (vol. i. pp. 247-56) the actions indicate a
more modern marriage ceremony. The young couple, after
choosing, go to church, clasp hands, put on ring, kneel down,
say prayers, kiss, and eat dinner. The clasping of hands,
putting on a ring, and kissing are more like a solemn
betrothal before a marriage ceremony.</p>

<p>In the other marriage games which show remains of a
ceremony are those of the kind to which &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_6">All the Boys</a>&#8221;
belongs (vol. i. pp. 2-6). In this game, customs which belong
to a rough and rude state of society are indicated. The
statement is made that a man cannot be happy without a
wife. He &#8220;huddles&#8221; and &#8220;cuddles&#8221; the girl, and &#8220;puts her
on his knee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The principal thing here to be noted is the mention in all
versions of this game the fact that some food is prepared by
the bride, which she gives to the bridegroom to eat. This,
although called a &#8220;pudding,&#8221; refers, of course, to the bridal
cake, and to the old custom of the bride preparing it herself,
and giving some to her husband first.</p>

<p>Other rhymes of this kind, belonging, probably, to the same
game, are &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_194">Down in the Valley</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_412">Mary mixed a Pudding</a>,&#8221;
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_8">Oliver, Oliver, follow the King</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#Add_26">Down in Yonder Meadow</a>.&#8221;
In all these the making and eating of a particular &#8220;pudding&#8221;
or food is mentioned as an important item; in two, catching
and kissing the sweetheart is mentioned; and in all, &#8220;courting&#8221;
and &#8220;cuddling&#8221;; articles for domestic use are said to be bought
by the bride. The formal ceremony of marriage is contained
in the verbal contract of the two parties, and the important
ceremony of the bridegroom and bride partaking of the bridal
food. The eating together of the same food is an essential
part of the ceremony among some savage and semi-civilised
peoples. The rhymes have a peculiar parallel in the rude and
rough customs associated with betrothal and marriage which
prevailed in Wales and the North of England.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<a href="#GameII_51">Poor Mary sits a-weeping</a>&#8221; (vol. ii. pp. 46-62) we have
very distinctly the desire of the girl for a &#8220;lover.&#8221; She is
&#8220;weeping&#8221; for a sweetheart, and, as in the case of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_120">Sally
Water</a>,&#8221; her weeping or &#8220;crying&#8221; is to make her &#8220;wan<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_493" id="PageII_493">[493]</a></span>t&#8221;
known. She is told by her companions to rise and make her
choice. In some versions the marriage lines follow, in others
the acceptance of the choice ends with the giving of a kiss.</p>

<p>Others of a similar kind are &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_276">Here stands a Young Man
who wants a Sweetheart</a>&#8221; (vol. i. p. 204), &#8220;<a href="#GameII_147">Silly Old Man
who wants a Wife</a>&#8221; (vol. ii. 196-99). This is a simple
announcement of the young man&#8217;s need for a wife or sweetheart
(probably originally intended to announce his having
arrived at manhood, as expressed in the expression, &#8220;he
ain&#8217;t a man till he&#8217;s got a sweetheart and gone a-courtin&#8217;&#8221;).
These verses are followed by the marriage formula. Games
of this kind are used for a kiss in the ring game, without the
chasing and capturing. The ordinary kiss in the ring games
are probably relics of older custom. These consist of one
person going round the assembled circle with a handkerchief
and choosing another of the opposite sex, after saying a
nominy or form of set words. This was probably originally
something in the shape of a &#8220;counting out&#8221; rhyme, to obtain
sweethearts by &#8220;lot.&#8221; A chase follows, and capture of the
girl, and the giving and receiving of a kiss in the circle.
This was a method of choosing sweethearts which prevailed
until quite a late period at country festivals and fairs, but at
an earlier period was a serious function. It is still customary
on Easter and Whit-Monday for this game to be played on
village greens, and the introduction thus afforded is held
sufficient to warrant continued acquaintance between young
people.</p>

<p>In connection with this class of games I must point out that
a game such as &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_280">Hey, Wullie Wine</a>&#8221; (vol. i. pp. 207-210),
though it cannot be considered exactly a marriage game, points
to the matter-of-fact way in which it was customary for young
people to possess sweethearts. It seems to have been thought
not only desirable, but necessary to their social standing. A
slur is cast on the young man or young woman who has no
lover, and so every facility is given them to make a choice
from among their acquaintances. In the game &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_365">King William</a>&#8221;
is a remnant of the disguising of the bride among some of
her girl friends and the bridegroom&#8217;s test of recognition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_494" id="PageII_494">[494]</a></span>
when that custom became one of the forms of amusement
at weddings.</p>

<p>The remaining love and marriage games mostly consist of
lines said in praise of some particular girl or young man, the
necessity of him or her possessing a sweetheart, and their
being married. These are probably fragments of the more
complete forms preserved in the other games of this class.
Marriage games, preceded by courtship or love-making, are
played in the second method of the circle form.</p>

<p>Among the games played in the first method of the circle form,
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_1">Oats and Beans and Barley</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#GameII_282">Would you know how doth
the Peasant</a>,&#8221; show harvest customs. The first of these (vol. ii.
pp. 1-13) shows us a time when oats, beans, and barley were
the principal crops grown, before wheat&#8212;now, and for some
time, one of the principal crops&#8212;came into such general cultivation
as at present. All the players join in singing the words
and performing the actions. They imitate sowing of seed,
folding arms and standing at ease while the corn is growing,
clap hands and stamp on the ground to awake the earth
goddess, and turning round and bowing, to propitiate the
spirit and do reverence to her. In &#8220;<a href="#GameII_282">Would you know how
doth the Peasant</a>&#8221; (ii. 399-401) we find actions performed
showing sowing, reaping, threshing, kneeling, and praying,
and then resting and sleeping. These actions are in both
games accompanied by dancing round hand in hand. These
two games, then, take us back to a time when a ceremony
was performed by all engaged in sowing and reaping grain;
when it was thought necessary to the proper growth of the
crops that a religious ceremony should be performed to propitiate
the earth spirit. I believe these games preserve the
tradition of the formula sung and danced at the spring festivals,
about which Mr. Frazer has written so fully.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="#GameII_1">Oats and Beans and Barley</a>&#8221; also preserves a marriage
formula, and after the religious formula has been sung and
danced, courting and marriage follows. A partner is said to be
wanted, is chosen, and the marriage ceremony follows. The
addition of this ceremony to the agricultural custom is of
considerable significance, especially as the period is that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_495" id="PageII_495">[495]</a></span>
spring, when, according to Westermarck, natural human marriage,
as also animal pairing, takes place. It is evidently
necessary to this game for all the players to perform the same
actions, and the centre player is not required until the choosing
a partner occurs. There is no centre player in the other agricultural
game, and no marriage occurs.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<a href="#GameII_264">When I was a Young Girl</a>&#8221; (ii. pp. 362-374) we have all
players performing actions denoting the principal events of their
lives from girlhood to old age. When young, enjoyment in the
form of dancing is represented (in present day versions, going
to school is taking the place of this), then courting, marriage,
nursing a baby, and occupations which women perform; the
death of the baby and of husband follows, and the woman takes
in washing, drives a cart to support herself, and finally gets
old. Here, again, there is little doubt that this game owes its
origin to those dances originally sacred in character, in which
men and women performed actions, accompanied with song and
dance, of the same nature as those they wished or intended to
perform seriously in their own lives. &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_429">Mulberry Bush</a>&#8221; is another
descendant of this custom. In &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_251">Green Gravel</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#GameII_257">Wallflowers</a>&#8221;
we have a death or funeral custom. Originally there
may have been other actions performed than those the game
contains now. These two are noticeable for the players turning
themselves round in the course of the play so that they
face outwards. It is this turning outwards, or &#8220;to the wall,&#8221;
which indicates hopeless sorrow and grief, and there is some
probability that the death mourned is that of a maiden, by the
other maidens of the village. The game is not a representation
of an ordinary funeral.</p>

<p>I must here refer to the game of &#8220;<a href="#Add_75">Rashes</a>&#8221; (Addenda,
ii. pp. 452, 453). I have not succeeded in obtaining a version
played now, and fear it is lost altogether, which is, perhaps,
not surprising, as the use of &#8220;rushes&#8221; has practically ceased;
but, as recorded by Mr. Radcliffe in 1873, there is no doubt it
represented the survival of the time when rushes were gathered
and used with ceremony of a religious nature.</p>

<p>Even in the extremely simple &#8220;<a href="#GameII_93">Ring a Ring of Roses</a>&#8221;
(ii. 108-111), now only a nursery game played by very young<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_496" id="PageII_496">[496]</a></span>
children, there can be traced a relationship to a dance, in
which the use of flowers, and all the dancers bowing or falling
prostrate to the ground together, with loud exclamations
of delight obtained. It may well be that sneezing, an imitation
of which is an essential part of the game, was actually a
necessary part of the ceremonial, and sneezing was always
considered of sacred significance among primitive peoples. It
is not probable that children would introduce this of their own
accord in a dance and &#8220;bop down&#8221; game.</p>

<p>The games played in the third method of this group are also
representative of custom. In &#8220;<a href="#GameII_6">Old Roger</a>&#8221; (vol. ii. pp. 16-24),
the circle of players is stationary throughout; the circle sings
the words describing the story, and the other players or actors
run into the circle and act their several parts in dumb show.
The story, it will be seen, is not the acting of a funeral, but
the planting of a tree over the grave of a dead person by
relatives and friends, and the spirit connection which this tree
has with the dead. The spirit of the dead &#8220;Old Roger&#8221; enters
the tree, and resents the carrying away of the fruit by the
old woman by jumping up and making her drop the apples.
Possession of the fruit would give her power over the
spirit. That the tree is sacred is clear; and I am tempted to
suggest that we may possibly have in this game a survival
of the worship of the sacred tree, and its attendant priest
watching until killed by his successor, as shown to us by
Mr. Frazer in the story of the &#8220;Golden Bough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="#GameII_106">Round and Round the Village</a>&#8221; (ii. pp. 122-143) shows us
the performance of a recurring festival very clearly in the words
which accompany all versions, &#8220;As we have done before.&#8221;
This conveys the idea of a special event, the event in the game
marriage, and I suggest that we have here a periodical village
festival, at which marriages took place. It is characteristic of
this, as in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_6">Old Roger</a>,&#8221; that the chorus or circle stand still
and sing the event, while the two characters act. This acting
is the dancing round the village, going in and out the windows
and houses, then choosing a lover, and &#8220;follow her to London.&#8221;
It is quite possible that the perambulation of boundaries with
which festive dances and courtship were often associated would<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_497" id="PageII_497">[497]</a></span>
originate this game. The perambulation was a recurring
custom periodically performed, and on p. 142, vol. ii., I have
given some instances of custom which, I think, confirm this.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<a href="#GameII_269">Who goes round my Stone Wall</a>&#8221; we find the players
in circle form, standing still and representing the houses of a
village (the stone wall), and also animals. The game represents
the stealing of sheep, one by one, from the village, by a
predatory animal or thief. In this game the circle do not sing
the story. That element has disappeared; the two actors
repeat a dialogue referring to the stealing of the sheep from
the &#8220;wall.&#8221; This dialogue is short, and is disappearing. The
game is not now understood, and consequently is dying out.
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_70">Booman</a>,&#8221; another of the same kind, represents a funeral.
The grave is dug in action, Booman is carried to his grave,
the dirge is sang over him, and flowers are pretended to be
strewn over.</p>

<p>There are other circle games, which it is not needful to
examine in detail. They are fragmentary, and do not present
any fresh features of interest. It is, however, important to
note that a few examples have evidently been derived from
love ballads, drinking songs, and toasts; some of the dance
games are of this origin. This may be explained by the fact
that children, knowing the general form of marriage games,
would naturally dance in circle form to any ballad verses in
which marriage or love and courtship occurs, and in this
manner the ballad would become apparently a fresh game,
though it would only be putting new words to an old formula
of action.</p>

<p>Dr. Jacob Jacobsen, in <i>Dialect and Place Names of Shetland</i>,
tells us that all the <i>vissiks</i> or ballads have been forgotten
since 1750, or thereby. They were sung to a dance, in which
men and women joined hands and formed a ring, moving
forwards, and keeping time with their hands and feet. Mr.
Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 78), records that &#8220;Barbara Allen&#8221; was
sung and danced in New England at children&#8217;s parties at a
period when dancing was forbidden to be taught in schools.
&#8220;Auld Lang Syne&#8221; is a further instance.</p>

<p>It will easily be seen that the circle games have a distinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_498" id="PageII_498">[498]</a></span>
characteristic compared with the line games. These, as I have
already pointed out, are games of contest, whereas the circle
games are games in which a homogeneous group of persons
are performing a ceremony belonging entirely to themselves.
The ceremony is of a religious character, as in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_1">Oats and
Beans and Barley</a>,&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="#GameII_6">Old Roger</a>,&#8221; dedicated to a spirit intimately
connected with the group who perform it, and having
nothing belonging to any outside group. The position of the
marriage ceremony in this group is peculiar. It has settled
down from the more primitive state of things shown in the line
marriage games, and has acquired a more social and domestic
form. Except in the very significant water custom in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_120">Sally
Water</a>,&#8221; which I have suggested (ii. pp. 176, 177) may take us
back to perhaps the very oldest stage of culture, all the games
in this group are evidently of a later formation. Let it be noted,
too, that the circle has deep religious significance not entirely
absent from the customs of comparatively later times, among
which the singing of &#8220;Auld Lang Syne&#8221; is the most generally
known.</p>

<p>But in speaking of matters of religious significance, it is
important to bear in mind that we are not dealing with the
religion of the Church. Everywhere it is most significant that
marriage ceremony, sacred rite, social custom, or whatever is
contained in these games, do not take us to the religion of
to-day. Non-Christian rites can only be pre-Christian in
origin, and these games therefore take us to pre-Christian
religious or social custom, and this is sufficient to stamp them
with an antiquity which alone would certify to the importance
of studying this branch of folk-lore.</p>

<p>To take now the dialogue or individual form of game, the
best example for my purpose is &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_425">Mother, Mother, the Pot boils
over</a>&#8221; (vol. i. pp. 396-401). Here the chorus has disappeared;
the principal characters tell the story in dialogue, the minor
characters only acting when the dialogue necessitates it, and
then in dumb show. This is an interesting and important game.
It is a complete drama of domestic life at a time when child-stealing
and witchcraft were rife. A mother goes out to work,
and returns to find one of her seven children missing. The game<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_499" id="PageII_499">[499]</a></span>
describes the stealing of the children one by one by the witch,
but the little drama tells even more than this. It probably
illustrates some of the practices and customs connected with
fire-worship and the worship of the hearth. There is a pot,
which is a magical one, and which boils over when each one of
the children is stolen and the mother&#8217;s presence is necessary.
A remarkable point is that the witch asks to borrow a light from
the fire. The objection to the giving of fire out of the house is
a well-known and widely-diffused superstition, the possession
of a brand from the house fire giving power to the possessor
over the inmates. The witch in this game takes away a child
when the eldest daughter consents to give her a light. The
spitting on the hearth gives confirmation to the theory that the
desecration of the hearth is the cause of the pot boiling over.
Instances of magical pots are not rare.<a name="FNanchor2_20" id="FNanchor2_20"></a><a href="#Footnote2_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote2_20" id="Footnote2_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Mr. W. F. Kirby refers me to the form of initiation into witchcraft in Saxony,
where the candidate danced round a pot filled with magic herbs, singing<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;I believe in this pot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And abjure God;&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or else it was<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;I abjure God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And believe in this pot.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

</div>

<p>After the children are stolen the mother has evidently a
long and troublesome journey in search of them; obstacles
are placed in her path quite in the manner of the folk-tale.
Blood must not be spilled on the threshold. This game,
then, which might be considered only as one of child-stealing,
becomes, when examined on the theories accompanying the
ancient house ritual, an extraordinary instance of the way
beliefs and customs have been dramatised, and so perpetuated.
Other games of a similar character to this, and perhaps derived
from it, are &#8220;<a href="#GameII_278">Witch</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_246">Gipsy</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameII_172">Steal the Pigs</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amongst other games classified as dialogue games are
those in which animals take part. In some there is a contest
between a beast of prey, usually a fox or wolf, and a hen
and her chickens or a goose and her goslings; in others
a shepherd or keeper guards sheep from a wolf, and in these
animals of the chase are hunted or baited for sport. In the
animal contest games, &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_227">Fox and Goose</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_272">Hen and Chickens</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_500" id="PageII_500">[500]</a></span>,&#8221;
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_247">Gled-wylie</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#Add_5">Auld Grannie</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#Add_69">Old Cranny Crow</a>,&#8221; all
played in the dialogue form, the dialogue announces that the
fox wants some food, and he arouses the suspicion of the
goose or hen by prowling around or near her dwelling. After
a parley, in which he tries to deceive the mother animal, he
announces his intention of catching one of the chickens. The
hen declares she will protect her brood, and a contest ensues.
These games have of course arisen from the well-known predatory
habits of the wolf, fox, and kite. On the other hand,
the games illustrating the hunting or baiting of animals, such
as &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_17">Baste the Bear</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_230">Fox in the Hole</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_263">Hare and Hounds</a>,&#8221;
are simply imitations of those sports. &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_17">Baiting the Bear</a>,&#8221; a
popular and still played game, has continued since the days of
bear-baiting.</p>

<p>I may also mention the games dealing with ghosts. &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_242">Ghost
at the Well</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_427">Mouse and Cobbler</a>,&#8221; show the prevailing belief
in ghosts. Playing at Ghosts has been one of the most
popular of games. These two show the game in a very degenerate
condition. I need not, I think, describe in detail any
more of the dialogue games. There are none so good as
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_425">Mother, the Pot boils over</a>,&#8221; but that was hardly to be expected.
The customs which no doubt were originally dramatised
in them all have in many cases been lost, as in the case
of some versions of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_425">Mother, the Pot boils over</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dialogue games appear to me to be later in form than both
line and circle games. They are, in fact, developments of these earlier
forms. Thus the &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_227">Fox and Goose</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_272">Hen and Chickens</a>&#8221;
type is played practically in line form, and belongs to the contest
group, while the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_278">Witch</a>&#8221; type is probably representative
of the circle form. But they have assumed a dramatic character
of a very definite shape. This, as will be seen later on,
is of considerable importance in the evidence of the ancient
origin of games; but I will only point out here that this group
has allowed the dramatic element to have full scope, with the
result that a pure dialogue has been evolved, while custom and
usage has to some extent been pushed in the background.</p>

<p>The next group is the arch form of game. This I divide
into two kinds&#8212;those ending in circle or dance form, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_501" id="PageII_501">[501]</a></span>
those ending with a contest between two leaders. Of this first
form there are several examples. &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_396">London Bridge</a>&#8221; (i. pp.
333-50) is possibly the most interesting. Two players form
the arch, all the others follow in single file. The words of
the story are sung while all the players run under or through
the arch. The players are all caught in turn in the arch, and
then stand aside; their part is finished. In some cases the
game begins by all forming a circle, and the verses are sung
while the circle dances round. The arch is then formed, and all
run through it in single file, and are caught in turn by being
imprisoned between the lowered arms. Also, we find the
circle-dancing following the arch ceremony. In my account
of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_396">this game</a> (vol. i. pp. 341-50), I have drawn attention to the
incident of a prisoner being taken as indicative of the widespread
custom known as the foundation sacrifice, because of
the suggested difficulty of getting the bridge to stand when
the prisoner is taken. I have given a few instances of the
custom, and the tradition that the stones of London Bridge
were bespattered with the blood of little children, and that the
mortar was tempered with the blood of beasts. In stories
where a victim is offered as a foundation-sacrifice, the victim,
often a prisoner, is sometimes forced to enter a hole or cavity
left on purpose in the building, which is then walled or built
up, enclosing the victim. In some, recourse to lottery is had;
in others, as at Siam, mentioned by Tylor (<i>Primitive Culture</i>,
i. 97), it was customary, when a new city gate was being
erected, for a number of officers to lie in wait and seize the
first four or eight persons who happened to pass by, and who
were then buried alive under the gate-posts. After these
customs of human sacrifice had ceased to be enforced, animals
were slaughtered instead; and later still the ceremony would
be performed, as a ceremony, by the incident being gone through,
the person or animal seized upon being allowed to escape the
extreme penalty by paying a money or other forfeit; and it
may be this later stage which is represented in the game.
The dancing in circle form, which belongs, I think, to the
original method of play, shows us a ceremony in which people
of one place are concerned, and would supersede an older line<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_502" id="PageII_502">[502]</a></span>
form of game, if there were one, when the custom showed a real
victim being taken from outsiders by force, who would resist the
demand. The circle dance would follow as the completion of
the ceremony. The &#8220;line&#8221; form would also be the first portion
of the game to disappear when once its meaning was lost.</p>

<p>The game, &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_265">Hark! the Robbers</a>&#8221; (i. 192-99) may be a
portion of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_396">London Bridge</a>&#8221; made into a separate game by
the part of the building being lost, or the children who play
both games may have mixed up the method of playing; but as
it ends in some places with a contest and in some with a dance,
it is difficult to say which is right.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="#GameII_196">Thread the Needle</a>,&#8221; played by all players running through
an arch and then dancing round, is a game well illustrated by
customs obtaining on Shrove Tuesday in different parts of the
country. All the children play &#8220;<a href="#GameII_196">Thread the Needle</a>&#8221; in the
streets of Trowbridge, Bradford-on-Avon, South Petherton,
Evesham, besides other places, in long lines, whooping
and shouting as they run through the arches they make.
After this they proceed to the churchyard, and encompassing
the church by joining hands, dance all round it three times,
and then return to their homes. Here is the undoubted performance
of what must have been an old custom, performed
at one time by all the people of the town, being continued as
an amusement of children. It was played at Evesham only
on Easter Monday, and in three other places only on Shrove
Tuesday, and another correspondent says played only on a
special day. In other places where it is played the game is not
connected with a special day or season. The circle dance does
not always occur, and in some cases the children merely run
under each other&#8217;s clasped hands while singing the words. In
the places above mentioned we see it as a game, but still
connected with custom. It is a pity that the words used by
the children on all these occasions should not have been
recorded too. &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_317">How many Miles to Babylon</a>&#8221; (vol. i. pp.
231-238) may with good reason be considered a game of the
same kind. It represents apparently a gateway of a town,
and a parley occurs between the gatekeepers and those
wishing to enter or leave the town. Small gateways or<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_503" id="PageII_503">[503]</a></span>
entrances to fortified towns were called needle&#8217;s eyes, which
were difficult to enter. But notwithstanding these apparent
identifications with the conditions of a fortified town, I think
the practice of going through the arch in this and in the previous
game relates to the custom which prevailed at festivals held
during certain seasons of the year, when people crept through
holed stones or other orifices to propitiate a presiding deity,
in order to obtain some particular favour. This would be
done by a number of people on the same occasion, and would
terminate by a dance round the church or other spot associated
with sacred or religious character. &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_397">Long Duck</a>&#8221; is another
probably almost forgotten version of this game.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_196">Draw a Pail of Water</a>&#8221; (vol. i. pp. 100-108), though not
quite in accord with the arch form in its present state, is certainly
one of the same group. This game I consider to be a
descendant of the custom of &#8220;well worship.&#8221; In its present
form it is generally played by children creeping under the arms
of two or four others, who clasp hands and sway backwards
and forwards with the other children enclosed in them. The
swaying movement represents, I believe, the drawing of water
from the well. The incidents of the game are:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>(1) Drawing water from a well.<br />
(2) For a devotee at a well.<br />
(3) Collecting flowers for dressing the well.<br />
(4) Making a cake for presentation.<br />
(5) Gifts to the well [a gold ring, silver pin, and probably a garter].<br />
(6) Command of silence.<br />
(7) The presence of devotee at the sacred bush.<br />
(8) The reverential attitude (indicated by the bowing and falling on the ground).</p>

<p>I can now add another incident, that of the devotee creeping
through a sacred bush or tree (signified by the creeping under
or getting enclosed within the arms of the leaders). These
are all incidents of primitive well worship.</p>

<p>I have from many different versions pieced together the
lines as they might appear in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_196">earlier versions</a> (i. p. 107).</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_504" id="PageII_504">[504]</a></p>

<p>This restoration, though it is far from complete, shows
clearly enough that the incidents belong to a ceremonial of
primitive well worship. Dressing holy wells with garlands
and flowers is very general; cakes were eaten at Rorrington
Well, Shropshire, and offerings of pins, buttons, and portions
of the dress, as well as small articles worn on the person,
are very general; silence is enforced in many instances, and
sacred trees and bushes are to be found at nearly all holy
wells. Offerings are sometimes hung in the bushes and trees,
sometimes thrown into the well. Miss Burne records in
<i>Shropshire Folk-Lore</i> (pp. 414, 433, 434) that at Rorrington
Green, in the parish of Chirbury, is a holy well, at which a
wake was celebrated on Ascension Day. The well was adorned
with green bowers, rushes, and flowers, and a maypole was
set up. The people used to walk round the hill with fife,
drum, and fiddle, dancing and frolicking as they went. They
threw pins into the well for good luck, and to prevent them from
being bewitched, and they also drank the water. Cakes were
eaten. These were round flat buns, from three to four inches
across, sweetened, spiced, and marked with a cross, and were
supposed to bring good luck if kept.</p>

<p>Instances of similar practices at holy wells could be multiplied,
and they are exhaustively examined in my husband&#8217;s
book on <i>Ethnology in Folk-Lore</i>. Halliwell records in
his nursery rhymes what is perhaps the oldest printed
version of the rhyme. He says the children form a
long string, hand in hand; one stands in front as leader,
two hold up their clasped hands to form an arch, and the
children pass under; the last is taken prisoner. Though
this way of playing does not appear to be used now&#8212;no
version, at least, has reached me&#8212;it is clear that the game
might be played in this way, probably as a commencement of
the ceremonial, and then the other positions might follow.
Halliwell may not have recorded it minutely or have heard
of it as a whole, or the version sent him may have been in
degenerate form. It is, however, clear that the arch form here
indicates a ceremonial, and not the taking of a prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="#GameII_10">Oranges and Lemons</a>&#8221; (vol. ii. pp. 25-35) is the best-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_505" id="PageII_505">[505]</a></span>
game of the arch form, followed by the contest or tug-of-war.
In this game two players, sometimes chosen by lot, clasp
hands and form an arch. They have each a name, which is
secret. One is called &#8220;Orange,&#8221; the other is &#8220;Lemon.&#8221; They
sing the words of the game-rhyme, and the other players run
under the arch in a long line or string. At the close of the
verses which ends with the line, &#8220;Here comes a chopper to
chop off your head,&#8221; one of the string of players is caught and
is asked which she prefers, orange or lemon. She chooses,
and is told to stand behind that leader who took that name.
This is repeated until all the players have been separately
caught, have chosen their side, and are standing behind the
respective leaders, holding on to each other by clasping each
other&#8217;s waists. A line is then drawn on the ground, and both
sides pull; each endeavours to drag the other over the line.
The tug is generally continued until one side falls to the
ground. Now this is an undoubted contest, but I do not think
the contest is quite of the same kind as the line game of contest
and fighting. The line form is one of invaders and invaded,
and the fight is for territory. In this form it seems to me that
the contest is more of a social contest, that is, between people
of the same place, perhaps between parishes and wards of
parishes, or burghers and apprentices (townspeople) on one side,
and the followers of lords or barons (military power) on the
other, or of two lords and barons. The leaders are chosen by
lot. Each leader has a &#8220;cry&#8221; or &#8220;colour,&#8221; which he calls out,
and the other players run and place themselves under the
banner they choose.</p>

<p>In my account of this game I draw particular attention to
the following details:&#8212;The game indicates contest and a
punishment, and although the sequence is not clear, as the
execution precedes the contest, that is not of particular importance
in view of the power of the old baronial lords to
threaten and execute those of their following who did not join
their armed retainers when required. All rhymes of this game
deal with saints&#8217; names and with bell ringing. Now, the only
places where it would be probable for bells to be associated
with different saints&#8217; names in one area would be the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_506" id="PageII_506">[506]</a></span>
parish units of cities and boroughs. The bells were rung
on all occasions when it was necessary to call the people
together. The &#8220;alarm&#8221; bell tolling quickly filled the open
spaces and market-places of the towns, and it is a well-known
fact that serious contests and contest games between parishes
and wards of parishes were frequent. The names &#8220;oranges&#8221;
and &#8220;lemons,&#8221; given to the leaders in the game, usually considered
to be the fruits of these names, are, in my opinion, the
names of the &#8220;colours&#8221; of the two rival factions.</p>

<p>The passing under the arch in this game is not absolutely
necessary in order that the players may exercise their choice
of leaders, nor is the &#8220;secrecy&#8221; which is observed necessary
either. Even this may have its origin in custom. It may
signify the compulsory attendance of a vassal under pain of
punishment to serve one side, or the taking prisoner and condemning
to death for serving on the opponents&#8217; or losing side.
An idea is current that it represents cutting off the last person&#8217;s
head, the last of the string or line of players, and in some
places the last one in the line is always caught instead of one
whom the leaders choose to enclose in their arms. Of course
a &#8220;laggard&#8221; or late arrival would be liable to suspicion and
punishment, and this idea may be suggested in the game;
but I do not think that the game originates from the idea of
catching a &#8220;last&#8221; player. The passing under the arch can
also be attributed to the custom of compelling prisoners to
pass under a yoke to signify servitude, and the threat of
execution would follow attempt to escape or disobedience.
Again, prisoners were offered life and freedom on condition
of joining the army of their opponents.</p>

<p>The other games of this method of play, &#8220;<a href="#GameII_197">Three Days&#8217;
Holiday</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#Add_81">Tug of War</a>,&#8221; are the same game under other
names, with only a nominy surviving, and the method of play.
Several games entered under the title of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_206">Through the Needle
Eye</a>,&#8221; are really the &#8220;arch&#8221; type with the &#8220;tug,&#8221; that is the
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_10">Oranges and Lemons</a>&#8221; game, instead of belonging to the
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_196">Thread the Needle</a>&#8221; or first form of arch type, as they are
usually considered. The Scottish form, described by Jamieson
(ii. p. 290), is an exception which should have been included<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_507" id="PageII_507">[507]</a></span>
with &#8220;<a href="#GameII_196">Thread the Needle</a>,&#8221; to which group it belongs.
The other games, &#8220;<a href="#GameII_206">Through the Needle Eye</a>,&#8221; have lost a
portion of their play, which probably accounts for the mixture
of name with the &#8220;<a href="#GameII_196">Thread the Needle</a>&#8221; games, because
of both containing the arch form. &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_433">Namers and Guessers</a>,&#8221;
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_222">Fool, Fool, come to School</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_392">Little Dog, I call you</a>,&#8221;
practically versions of one and the same game, which I have
classed in this type because of the &#8220;tug,&#8221; have an additional
element of guessing in them. The leader or namer on one
side and the guesser on the other take sides. All the players
have names given them, and it is the first business of the
guesser to guess which of the players has taken a particular
name. If he guesses correctly, he takes that player on his
side; if incorrectly, he stays on the namer&#8217;s side. After he
has &#8220;guessed&#8221; at all the players, the &#8220;tug&#8221; follows, and the
beaten side has further to run the gauntlet between two lines
of the successful side. This game, having all its players
chosen by guessing, by what might have been originally choosing
by &#8220;lot&#8221; or by magical powers, may have an entirely
different meaning, but it is clearly a contest game, although
there is no indication as to the why or wherefore. The
punishment of &#8220;running the gauntlet&#8221; is found in the game,
which again indicates military fighting.</p>

<p>This group of games, though small, is perhaps one of the
most indicative of early custom, for beyond the custom which
is enshrined in each game&#8212;foundation sacrifice, well worship,
&amp;c.&#8212;it will be noticed there is a common custom belonging to
all the games of this group; this is the procession under the
arch. The fact that this common custom can also be referred
to primitive usage, confirms my view that the particular
customs in each game owe their origin to primitive usage.

<p>Mr. Albany F. Major has also kindly drawn my attention
to the following interesting passages from the sagas, which
Dr. Jon Stefansson has kindly translated as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In old times this had been the custom of brave men, who made
an agreement (pact) that the one who lived the longest should
revenge the other&#8217;s death. They were to go under three earth-sods,
and that was their oath (ei&eth;r). This ceremony (leikr) of theirs was
in this wise, that three long earth-sods (turfs) should be cut loose.
All the ends were to be fast in the ground (adhere to it), but the
coils (bends) were to be pulled upward, so that a man might go<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_509" id="PageII_509">[509]</a></span>
under them. This play Thorgeir and Thormod went through.&#8221;&#8212;<i>F&oacute;stbr&aelig;dra
Saga</i>, ed. 1822, ch. i. p. 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now is spread about this report of Thorkell and his men, but
Gudmund had before told [the story] somewhat otherwise. Now
that tale seemed to those kinsmen of Thorarins somewhat doubtful,
and they said they would not put trust in it without proof, and they
claimed for themselves [to share] half the property with Thorkell,
but Thorkell thought to own it himself alone, and bade go to ordeal
after their custom. This was then the [form of] ordeal at that time,
that they should go under an earth-belt, that is, a sod [which] was
ripped up from the field. The ends of the sod must be fast in the
field, but the man who was to perform the ordeal must go thereunder.
Thorkell of the Scarf somewhat suspects whether the death
of those men can have happened in the way that Gudmund and his
men had said the latter time. Now, heathen men thought that they
had no less at stake, when they had to play such a part, than
Christian men think nowadays when ordeals are held. Then the
man who went under the earth-belt was clear if the sod fell not on
him. Thorkell took counsel with two men that they should let
themselves fall out about something or other, and be there standing
near at hand when the ordeal was being performed, and should
touch the sod so hard that all might see that they brought it down.
After this the man who was to perform the ordeal starts, and as soon
as he was come under the earth-belt those men who were set to do
it sprang to meet each other under arms, and they encounter near
the bend of the sod and lie fallen there, and the earth-belt fell down,
as was to be expected. At once men spring between them and
separate them; that was easy, because they were fighting with no
risk to life. Thorkell of the Scarf asked what people thought of the
ordeal; now all his men say that it would have done well if no one
had spoilt it. Then Thorkell took all the loose property, but the
land is joined on to Hrappstead.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Laxd&aelig;la Saga</i>, ch. xviii.</p>

<p>&#8220;Berg gave notice of the blow for the Hunawaterthing and began
the lawsuit there. As soon as men came to the thing they tried to
arrange a settlement. Berg said that he would not take payment in
atonement, and would only be reconciled under these terms, that
Jokull should go under three earth-belts, as was then the custom after
great transgressions, &#8216;and thus show humility towards me.&#8217; Jokull
said the trolls should take him before he thus bowed himself.
Thorstein said it was a matter for consideration, &#8216;and I will go
under the earth-belts.&#8217; Berg said then would the matter be paid
for. The first earth-belt reached to the shoulder, the next to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_510" id="PageII_510">[510]</a></span>
waist-belt, the third to mid-thigh. Then Thorstein went under
the first. Then said Berg: &#8216;Now I make thee stoop like a swine,
who wast the loftiest of the Vatnsdale men.&#8217; Thorstein answers,
&#8216;That hadst thou no need to say, but this will be the first return for
those words, that I will not go under any more.&#8217; Finnbogi said, &#8216;That
is clearly not well said, but then not much comes in repayment for
Berg&#8217;s wrong, that he gat from Jokull, if the matter shall here come
to a standstill, and everything seems to you lowly by the side of
you Vatnsdale men, and I will challenge thee, Thorstein, to holm-gang
a week hence by the stackyard which stands on the island
down before my farm at Borg.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;<i>Vatnsd&aelig;la Saga</i>, ch. xxxiii.</p></blockquote>

<p>These significant customs, I think, bear out my theory as to
the origin of the games played in the two methods of the arch
form.</p>

<p>Lastly, I come to the &#8220;winding up&#8221; games. &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_211">Eller Tree</a>&#8221;
(i. p. 119) and &#8220;<a href="#GameII_275">Wind up the Bush Faggot</a>&#8221; (ii. pp. 384-387),
show a game in which a tree or bush is represented, and is probably
indicative of tree worship. The tallest player represents
the tree, and all the other players walk round and round in line
form, getting closer and closer each time, until all are wound
round the centre player. They call out when winding round
&#8220;The old tree gets thicker and thicker,&#8221; and then jump all
together, calling out &#8220;A bunch of rags,&#8221; and try and tread on
each other&#8217;s toes. This last action is evidently performed
from not understanding the action of stamping, which is,
without doubt, the object of the players. It is probable that
this game descends from the custom of encircling the tree
(Mr. Addy suggests the alder-tree) as an act of worship, and
the allusion to the &#8220;rags&#8221; bears at least a curious relationship
to hanging rags on sacred trees. A ceremonial of this kind
would probably take place each spring, and the stamping on
the ground would be, as in &#8220;<a href="#GameII_1">Oats and Beans and Barley</a>,&#8221; a
part of the ceremony to awake and arouse the earth spirit to
the necessity of his care for the trees under his charge. The
connection of all the players, by means of the clasped hands,
with the central figure or tree, may also be considered a means
of communicating life and action to it; the tree requiring contact
with living and moving creatures to enable it to put forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_511" id="PageII_511">[511]</a></span>
its leaves. In a version of this game from Lincoln, called the
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_275">Old Oak Tree</a>&#8221; (ii. p. 386), we find practically the same
words and same actions, the dancing round and jumping up
and down are constant features of this game. It remains in
some degenerate versions from Scotland (<i><a href="#GameII_275">ibid.</a></i>), where the
game has assumed the modern name of &#8220;<a href="#GameII_101">Rolling Tobacco</a>.&#8221; In
&#8220;<a href="#GameII_275">Wind up the Bush Faggot</a>&#8221; we have again the tree or bush
suggested, and the dancing and jumping, or stamping up and
down. In Shropshire it is the closing game of any playtime,
and was played before &#8220;breaking-up&#8221; at a boys&#8217; school in
Shrewsbury in 1850-1856. This tends to show that the game
had originally been played at a special time or season.</p>

<p>For an example of this custom I may repeat (from <a href="#PageII_386">ii. p. 386</a>)
that in mid-Cornwall, in the second week in June, at St. Roche
and one or two adjacent parishes, a curious dance, like a
serpent&#8217;s coil, is performed at the annual &#8220;feasts.&#8221; The
young people are assembled in a meadow, and the band plays
a lively tune. The band leads, and all the people follow
hand in hand. The band or head keeps marching in an
ever-narrowing circle, while its train of dancing followers
becomes coiled round it in circle after circle. Then the
band, taking a sharp turn about, begins to retrace the circle,
still followed as before, and a number of young men, with
long leafy branches in their hands as standards, direct this
counter-movement. Although there is no mention of a tree
in the account round which this ceremony is performed, the
custom is so striking as to leave very little doubt of their connection.
Lady Wilde (<i>Ancient Cures, Charms, and Usages of
Ireland</i>, p. 106) says, &#8220;On May-Day in Ireland all the young
men and maidens hold hands, and dance in a circle round a
tree hung with ribbons or garlands, or round a bonfire, moving
in curves from left to right, as if imitating the windings of a
serpent.&#8221; This is a closer parallel to the game still, and leaves
no doubt as to its connection with custom. There may be,
too, some connection between these winding-up or serpentine
dances and the Maypole dances on May-Day in England.</p>

<p>The detail into which I have gone in the case of these games
makes it, I think, unnecessary that I should enter into equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_512" id="PageII_512">[512]</a></span>
detail in other customs mentioned in the classification. Thus,
with regard to the funeral customs indicated in &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_338">Jenny Jones</a>,&#8221;
we have not only a ceremony of burial, but the courting of a
maiden or maidens by a band of suitors, the opposition of
the mother or guardians to their suit, the putting forward of
domestic occupations as pretexts for refusal; there is also the
illness, dying and death of the maiden, the manner of her
funeral indicated by the colour selected for her burial, followed
by the burial itself, the singing of the lament or funeral dirge,
and, in some versions, the rising of the ghost or spirit of the
departed. This game in its best versions is played in line
form. But in those versions where two children only play
the parts of &#8220;mother&#8221; and &#8220;Jenny Jones,&#8221; there is also
evidence of the tendency of the game to develop into the
individual form.</p>

<p>Again, those games in which &#8220;guessing&#8221; occurs remind
us of the important part that guessing or chance plays in
the beliefs of the savage and uncivilised. A person who, by
a guess, discovers a special person out of a number, or the
exact number of articles concealed in a hand or under a foot,
has something of the supernatural or witch-element about him.
This is largely the foundation of the belief in witchcraft and
the sorcerer. It is not surprising to find, therefore, the
guessing-element largely extant in the dramatic game. The
&#8220;guesser&#8221; is usually chosen by lot by means of the counting-out
rhyme; the leader then proceeds to confuse the guesser&#8217;s
or witch&#8217;s mind by re-naming secretly the rest of the players.
He calls the &#8220;guesser,&#8221; and in a doggerel rhyme (the remains
or imitation probably of an incantation), tells him to pick
out or name a certain person or thing. If the guess is correct,
the &#8220;guesser&#8221; takes that person to his side, indicating power
over that individual or thing. If the &#8220;guesser&#8221; is unsuccessful,
he is scouted, mocked, and ill-used.</p>

<p>I now proceed with the second classification referred to on
<a href="#PageII_461">p. 461</a>. Of the games classified on <a href="#PageII_461">pp. 461-470</a>, <i>ante</i>, it will
be found on examination that nearly all of them are dramatic
in form. This leads me at once to suggest that so important<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_513" id="PageII_513">[513]</a></span>
a phase of their character needs separate investigation, and
this I proceed to do.</p>

<p>In the first place, it will be found that certain of the games
are wholly dramatic whatever may be the customs or rites they
imitate. These games are of two classes&#8212;first, where dramatic
action is complete throughout the whole game, that is where
singing, action, and words are represented; secondly, where
singing has dropped out, action and words only remaining.</p>

<p>These two classes are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Nearly all the remaining dramatic games form a third class,
namely, those where action remains, and where both words
and singing are either non-existent or have been reduced to
the merest fragments.</p>

<p>In order to complete the investigation from the point we
have now reached, it is necessary to inquire what is the controlling
force which has preserved ancient custom in the form
of children&#8217;s games. The mere telling of a game or tale from
a parent to a child, or from one child to another, is not alone
sufficient. There must be some strong force inherent in these
games that has allowed them to be continued from generation to
generation, a force potent enough to almost compel their continuance
and to prevent their decay. This force must have
been as strong or stronger than the customs which first
brought the games into existence, and I identify it as the
dramatic faculty inherent in mankind.</p>

<p>A necessary part of this proposition is, that the element of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_515" id="PageII_515">[515]</a></span>
the dramatic in children&#8217;s games is more ancient than, or at
all events as ancient as, the customs enshrined in the games
themselves, and I will first of all see if this is so.</p>

<p>With the child the capacity to express itself in words is
small and limited. The child does not apparently pay as
much attention to the language of those adults by whom he
is surrounded as he does to their actions, and the more limited
his vocabulary, the greater are his attempts at expressing his
thoughts by action. Language to him means so little unless
accompanied by action. It is too cold for a child. Every one
acquainted with children will be aware of their dramatic way
of describing to their mother or nurse the way in which they
have received a hurt through falling down the stairs or out of
doors, or from knocking their heads against articles of furniture.
A child even, whose command of language is fairly good,
will usually not be content to say, &#8220;Oh, mother, I fell down
and knocked my head against the table,&#8221; but will say, &#8220;Oh, I
fell down like this&#8221; (suiting the action to the word by throwing
himself down); &#8220;I knocked my head like this&#8221; (again suiting
the action to the word by knocking the head against the table),
and does not understand that you can comprehend how he got
hurt by merely saying so. He feels it necessary to show you.
Elders must respond in action as well as in words to be understood
by children. If &#8220;you kiss the place to make it well,&#8221;
and if you bind up a cut or sore, something has been done
that can be seen and felt, and this the child believes in as a
means of healing. A child understands you are sorry he has
been hurt, much more readily than if you say or repeat that
you are sorry; the words pass almost unheeded, the action
is remembered.</p>

<p>Every one, too, must have noticed the observation of detail a
child will show in personifying a particular person. When a
little child wishes to personate his father, for instance, he will
seat himself in the father&#8217;s chair, cross his legs, pick up a piece
of paper and pretend to read, or stroke an imaginary beard or
moustache, put on glasses, frown, or give a little cough, and
say, &#8220;Now I&#8217;m father,&#8221; if the father is in the habit of indulging
in either of the above habits, and it will be found that sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_516" id="PageII_516">[516]</a></span>
in the chair (if a special chair is used by the father to sit in
when at home) is the foundation and most important part of
the imitation. Other men of the child&#8217;s acquaintance read
papers, smoke, wear glasses, &amp;c., but father sits in that chair;
therefore to be father, sitting in the chair is absolutely necessary,
and is sufficient of itself to indicate to others that
&#8220;father&#8221; is being personified, and not another person. To
be &#8220;mother&#8221; a child will pretend to pour out tea, or sew,
or do some act of household work, the doing of which is
associated with &#8220;mother,&#8221; while a lady visitor or a relative
would be indicated by wearing hat or bonnet or silk dress,
carrying a parasol, saying, &#8220;How do you do?&#8221; and carrying
on conversation. Again, too, it is noticeable how a child realises
a hurt if blood and swelling ensues after a knock. This is
something that can be seen and shown.</p>

<p>When wishing to be an animal, a child fixes at once on
some characteristic of that animal which is special to it, and
separates it from other animals similar in other ways. Children
never personate horses and cows, for instance, in the same
manner. Horses toss their heads, shake their manes, paw the
ground, prance, and are restless when standing still, gallop and
trot, wear harness, and their drivers have reins and a whip.
When a child is a cow he does none of these things; he walks
in a slower, heavier way, lowers the head, and stares about as
he moves his head from side to side, lies down on the ground
and munches; he has horns, and rubs these against a tree or
a fence.</p>

<p>A child of mine, when told that he must not run in the
gutter when out of doors, because that was not the place for
little boys, replied, &#8220;I am not a little boy now, I am a dog, so I
may run in the gutter.&#8221; When he came into the path again he
became a boy.</p>

<p>Again the same child, when called by his name and told to
come out from under a table, a round one, under which he was
lying rubbing his head against the pedestal centre, because
under the table was not the place for little boys, said, &#8220;But
I&#8217;m not [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], I&#8217;m a cow, and it&#8217;s not a table, it&#8217;s a tree,
and I&#8217;m rubbing my horns.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_517" id="PageII_517">[517]</a></span>Again, when personating a train, the actions used are completely
different from those used when personating an animal.
The child moves at a steady rate, the feet progressing without
raising the legs more than necessary, because engines only
have wheels, which keep close to the ground; they don&#8217;t
jump up like feet do, the arms are used as the propeller, and
the puffing and screeching, letting off steam, taking in water,
are imitated in sound to perfection. This is entirely on the
child&#8217;s own initiative. When children play in groups the same
things occur. Instances could be given <i>ad nauseam</i>. It cannot,
therefore, surprise us that in these games children should
be found to use actions which indicate to them certain persons
or things, although the words they use may render action unnecessary,
as action is to them most important. Children,
when acting these games or dramas, appear not to need the
element of dress or of particular garments to indicate their
adoption of certain characters or characteristics. To display
your heels and look down at them while doing so signifies a
man who wears spurs, a knight; to prance along as if a horse,
shows a man on horseback, a duke a-riding. A child lies or
stoops down and shuts her eyes, she is dead; if she is passively
carried by two others a little distance, she is going to be buried.
The child, by standing still, becomes a tree, a house, or a stone
wall. If an animal is required to be shown, down goes the
child on hands and knees, bends her head down, and the
animal is there. If a gate, fortress, or castle is wanted, two
children join hands, and their arms are raised or lowered when
required for opening the gate, &amp;c. If one child is to personate
a &#8220;mother,&#8221; one or two or more smaller children are placed
behind or beside her as her children, because &#8220;mothers have
children,&#8221; and so on. Many other examples could be given
from these games of the same kind of thing. There is, then, no
difficulty as to the reason why children should have continued
playing at these games when once they had seen their elders
play them or similar performances, nor why children should
not have embodied in a game or play some of the manners and
customs which were constantly going on around them in olden
times as they do now, imitating the habits and customs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_518" id="PageII_518">[518]</a></span>
the men and women and animals by whom they were surrounded.</p>

<p>We know from the evidence of those who have collected the
games that many were played as amusements by young men and
women up to a few years ago. Some are still so played, and
some years further back it was a general practice for men and
women in country districts to play these or similar games at
fairs and festivals; it is unlikely that adults would play seriously
at children&#8217;s games, but children having seen their elders
playing at these amusements would adopt them and use
them in their turn, until these amusements become in turn too
frivolous and childish for them. It is not so very many years
since that the then educated or cultured classes amused themselves
by occupations now deemed silly and unfit even for
children of the uneducated class&#8212;witness practical joking, cock-fighting,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The natural instinct to dramatic action in children is paralleled
by the same instinct in grown-up people when in a state
of culture where they are chiefly dependent upon their natural
capacities for existence. Thus evidence of the natural dramatic
power in savages and in semi-civilised races is abundant. The
dances of savages are strongly dramatic. They advance in
lines dancing, gesticulating, and singing, while others sit and
look on; they dance in circles joining hands, they go down on
all fours imitating animal postures and noises, they wear
masks, special dresses and ornaments, and these have significance
for their audience. Some of these dances are peculiar
to and only witnessed by men, others performed by men are
witnessed by both sexes. These ceremonial dances are performed
principally at the celebration of the initiative rites, but
some also represent other customs periodically performed.</p>

<p>Catlin&#8217;s (<i>North American Indians</i>) description of the Buffalo
dance among the Mandan Indians shows the dancers wearing
masks made of a buffalo&#8217;s head and horns, and a tail hanging
down behind. The dancers went through the actions of
hunting, being shot with bow and arrow, skinned and cut up,
accompanied by singing and yelling. This dance was performed
as a ceremony when food was required and the hunters were<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_519" id="PageII_519">[519]</a></span>
at a loss, and would continue until a herd of buffalos came in
sight on the prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. W. E. Roth gives dances accompanied by songs and
pantomimic action and games practised by the N.W. Central
Australian aborigines.<a name="FNanchor2_21" id="FNanchor2_21"></a><a href="#Footnote2_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In &#8220;Secular and Ceremonial Dances of Torres Straits&#8221;
(<i>Zeit. f&uuml;r Ethnogr.</i>, vi. 1893, p. 131), Dr. Haddon describes a
&#8220;saw-fish dance&#8221; performed by natives. He says &#8220;the advent
of different seasons of the year is celebrated by ceremonies
amongst most peoples; the most frequent of these are harvest
festivals, or periods of rejoicings at the abundance of food.
Very frequent also are ceremonies which relate to the preparing
for crops or the inauguration of a season which promises
abundant food supply. The saw-fish dance belongs to the
latter class.&#8221; Dr. Haddon visited the men, and saw the making
of the masks which he describes at length. These were worn
by the dancers, and consisted of an imitation of a human face
resting on a crocodile&#8217;s head, and surmounted by a figure of a
saw-fish represented in a traditional method. The dance,
which lasted for hours, was accompanied by singing a chant,
the words of which served as a description of the meaning of
the dance. This dance is performed to ensure a good harvest
from the sea.</p>

<p>He also refers to dramatic death dances and war dances, and
describes some interesting forms of other dances, one in which
crabs are represented. He says, all the men dance in single
file, and each man during the dance performs some definite
movements which illustrate an action in real life, such as agricultural,
nautical, or fishing employments; for example, a man
would crouch and move his hands about as if he were planting
yams or looking for pearl shell at the bottom of the sea. These
movements are known to the spectators, though the foreign
observer may not catch the allusion. Probably most of these
actions have become more or less conventionalised during
innumerable dance representations, just as some of the adjuncts
to the dance are degenerate representations of objects used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_520" id="PageII_520">[520]</a></span>
everyday life. In the war dance the actions illustrate the
method pursued in war, ending with an evolution which represented
the successful warriors threading the heads of the slain
on the rattan slings which always hung on their backs when
they went out to fight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murray-Aynsley in a paper on the secular and religious
dances in Asia and Africa (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vol. v.
pp. 273, 274), describes an aboriginal dance which still takes
place annually in certain villages in the Khassia and Jaintia
hills. It generally takes place in May. The special reason
of the dance is the display of all the unmarried girls from
far and near to choose, or be chosen by, suitable parties,
and from description it is probable that the girls choose.
Many marriages result from this one annual dance. The
dances take place in a circular enclosure which is set apart for
this annual feast. The musicians sit in the centre, and the
girls form a large circle round the musicians, and behind the
girls, holding hands in a larger circle, the men dance and go
through their part of the performance. The girls perform very
quiet movements and dance slowly, while the men jig, leap,
hop, and wave their arms, legs, umbrellas, and <i>daos</i> in the
wildest confusion, accompanying their movements with the
most savage war-whoops, signifying nothing. It is also usual
for the men to dance when one of their tribe is buried.</p>

<p>In the Kulu district at Sultanpore is held the feast of Rugonath,
the chief god, when the gods belonging to every village
in the valley are bound to appear and pay him respect. There
is feasting, and the men dance round and round the palanquins
containing the inferior gods. When the excitement is at its
height the temple attendants seize the palanquins and dance
them up and down violently, and make the godlings salaam to
each other and to Rugonath, the chief god.</p>

<p>In Spiti, a valley in the Western Himalayas, the people frequently
dance for hours for their own amusement. Men and
women dance together, all join hands and form a long line or
circle. They commence by singing, then dance to the accompaniment
of their own voices, and the fun speedily becomes
fast and furious (<i>ibid.</i> p. 281).</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_521" id="PageII_521">[521]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Lamas there are also religious and secular
dances performed at their feasts or fairs, the religious dances
by the Lamas, the secular by men and women together, or by
each sex separately. In one dance those who take part form
themselves into two long lines. Each dancer holds on to the
one in front of him, as in our game of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_227">Fox and Goose</a>.&#8221; The
two strings of dancers wind in and out, then divide and dance
opposite each other, advancing and receding with a slow undulating
movement, which gradually becomes more energetic.
Mock sword fights then take place between two combatants,
also sword dances, with two crossed weapons laid on the
ground, and precisely like those performed at our Highland
gatherings. In the religious dances each man wears a gigantic
headpiece, which comes down as far as the shoulders. Some
of the masks are ornamented. They perform several different
dances, in which separate characters are performed, one a
Chinese mandarin and his wife, another, two actors wear masks
resembling ferocious-looking dogs, one places himself against
the entrance door, the other guards the door of exit. They
remind one, says Mrs. Murray-Aynsley, of the divan-palas, or
doorkeepers, whose statues are seen placed as guards on each
side of the shrine of some old Hindu temple. In Algeria the
dancing at weddings is performed by men and women. Before
each woman went out to dance she was enveloped in a garment
which covered her from head to feet, her hands even not being
visible, the sleeves being drawn over and tied at the ends so
that the hands and arms were enclosed as in a bag. This was
apparently a form of disguise, as one woman was sent back
because her husband had discovered her. At a funeral also
hired female mourners were dancing on the surface of a newly-made
grave and uttering wild shrieks.</p>

<p>An interesting account of the war-dance of the Coorgis is
also given (<i>ibid.</i> p. 251). &#8220;The Coorgis assembled in a clearing
in the natural jungle. The forest was only illumined by
jungle. The torch-bearers formed a large circle; within the
open space, in the centre, were the musicians. One dance
was very peculiar, inasmuch as it seemed to be a remnant of
a period when every man&#8217;s hand was against his brother&#8217;s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_522" id="PageII_522">[522]</a></span>
The performers may consist of any equal number of persons;
they always dance in pairs. Before they begin each man is
given a bundle of sticks or bamboos. This he holds in his
left hand, and a stouter stick is given him in his right hand.
At first all the men dance round and round, with head erect, as
if going to war. Presently they narrow the circle and assume
a crouching attitude, their eyes glancing here, there, and
everywhere. The respective adversaries have been singled
out; the intending aggressors make a feint or two, then bend
their knees so that they are only about two-thirds of their
ordinary stature; at the same time they place their feet
together and make a succession of bounds, or rather hops,
like a frog, and with the sticks the attacking party aim cuts
at the legs of the men whom they selected as their adversaries.
The latter now takes up the same attitude; he wards off
attack, and returns the blow if he can. Whether intentionally
or not, one party is victorious in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A curious dance is also executed by Hindu women at
Sagar, in the Central Provinces of India (<i>ibid.</i> p. 253). Men
are present, but as spectators only. Some little time before
preparations have been made for this feast. Wheat or other
grain has been sown in earth placed in pots made of large
leaves, held together by thorns of a species of acacia. The
richer women walk along, followed by their attendants carrying
trays filled with such pots; the poorer people carry their
own plants. As soon as each procession arrives at the ghat,
or flight of steps leading down to the lake, every family-circle
of friends deposit their pots on the ground and dance round
them. After a time the dancers descend to the water&#8217;s edge,
taking their pots of earth and corn with them. They then
wash away the soil from the plants, and distribute these
amongst their friends. The whole of the ceremony is observed
by the men, but they take no part in it. It probably fixes
the season for sowing some particular crop.&#8221;</p>

<p>These amongst others are all dances of semi-civilised
peoples, and these dances, being all of a ceremonial nature,
are probably derived from older customs, and performed in
commemoration of these.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_523" id="PageII_523">[523]</a></p>

<p>There are also surviving some ceremonial dances, such as
the singular ceremony observed at Echternach, in Luxemburg,
on Whit-Tuesday, in which ten or fifteen thousand pilgrims
take part. Professor Attwell thus describes it in <i>Notes and
Queries</i> of May 17, 1890:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Early on the morning of Whit-Tuesday pilgrims arrive at
Echternach from the neighbouring villages, some alone, or in
little family parties, some in small bodies personally conducted
by their <i>cur&eacute;s</i>, singing litanies in honour of St. Willibrord.
At about eight o&#8217;clock the bells of the parish church begin
to peal, and the clergy, intoning the &#8216;Veni Creator,&#8217; and
preceded by numerous banners, issue from the principal porch
and march along the bank of the Sure to a stone crucifix, near
which, from an extemporised pulpit, the crowd is addressed.
The short sermon ended, the procession begins. It is headed
by a choir of some hundreds of voices chanting antiphonally
with the clergy the litanies of the saint. Then come numerous
ecclesiastics, followed by a band playing the cadenced music
of the dance. The pilgrims are headed by young children
and men and women belonging to the parish, after whom
comes the throng, in groups of from three to six persons of
either sex. The dancers take three jumps forward and one
backward, or five forward and two backward. It is, of course,
impossible for a moving crowd consisting of many thousands
to keep anything like time, save those who are near one of the
many bands of music, which, at irregular intervals, accompany
the procession. No special order is observed, but there is no
confusion. Poor mothers with sickly children in their arms
jump side by side with young well-to-do girls; old men,
broken with toil, jump in step with vigorous fellows in the
heyday of youth. Water and wine are freely offered by
the townsfolk to the pilgrims, many of whom sink exhausted
under the unwonted effort. It sometimes happens that sick
persons get paid substitutes to perform for them the expiatory
jumping. The distance traversed is less than a mile, but the
time occupied is fully two hours. Before the church can be
entered sixty-four steps have to be mounted. But the singular
backward and forward movements and the accompanying music<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_524" id="PageII_524">[524]</a></span>
are continued, not only while the steps are ascended, but
during the circumambulation of the church, beneath the altar
of which is the tomb of the saint. On reaching the hallowed
shrine the devotees manifest their enthusiasm in various ways,
kneeling before the altar, which is surrounded by votive offerings,
with sobs and gesticulations. When the whole of the
immense multitude has passed the shrine, the clergy ascend
the altar, the &#8216;Salve Regina&#8217; is sung, the Benediction is
given, and the imposing ceremony is ended.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grimm also records the fact that about the year 1133 in
a forest near Inda (Ripuaria) a ship was built, set upon
wheels, and drawn about the country by men who were yoked
to it, first to Aachen (Aix), and up the river to Tongres,
Looz, and so on, everywhere with crowds of people assembling
and escorting it. Wherever it halted there were joyful shouts,
songs of triumph, and dancing round the ship, kept up till far
into the night. This Grimm describes as a recollection of an
ancient heathen festival. It was utterly repugnant to and
opposed strongly by the clergy as a sinful and heathenish
piece of work. On the other hand, the secular power authorised
and protected it (<i>Teutonic Mythology</i>, i. 258).</p>

<p>The story of the pied piper of Hamelin probably commemorates
a procession similar to the Echternach (see <i>Folk-lore
Journal</i>, vol. ii. 209).</p>

<p>With this may also be noted a dance recorded by Mr. Newell
(<i>Games of American Children</i>, p. 89), who states that the
name &#8220;Threading the Needle&#8221; is given to a dance in which
hundreds take part; in which from time to time the pair who
form the head of the row raise their arms to allow the line to
pass through, coiling and winding like a great serpent. When a
French savant asked the peasants of La Ch&acirc;tre why they performed
this dance, the answer was, &#8220;To make the hemp grow.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remember when quite a small child planting hemp seeds
in a patch of garden ground, and being told by a maid-servant,
an illiterate country girl, that the seeds would not grow well
unless we danced, we joined hands and danced round and
round in a circle, then stooped down and jumped about, saying,
&#8220;Please, God, send it all up,&#8221; then again danced round.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_525" id="PageII_525">[525]</a></span>
This may have been said only to amuse us, but it may also
have been the remains of an old festival dance. I believe
there were more words, but I cannot remember them. Hemp
seed is associated with ceremonies of magical nature, being
one of those used by maidens as a charm to enable them to
see a future husband.</p>

<p>Representation in pantomime of the different actions used in
the ceremonies of sowing the grain, its growth, and the consequent
reaping, binding, and carrying the grain, are practised
in different parts of the globe. This is brought down to later
times by the custom noted on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_395">p. 319, vol. i.</a>, where from <i>Long
Ago</i> and Best&#8217;s <i>Rural Economy of Yorkshire</i> (1641), instances
are given of it being customary, at harvest-homes, to give
representations of &#8220;hirings&#8221; of farm-servants. The hiring of
a farm labourer, the work he had to do, his terms of service,
and the food to be supplied him, were dramatically performed,
showing clearly that it had been customary to go through this
sort of thing, in earnest of what was expected&#8212;in fact, a sort
of oral contract, in presence of witnesses.</p>

<p>I will conclude this part of my evidence by a summary of
the conclusions arrived at by anthropological authorities.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock, in <i>Origins of Civilisation</i> (fifth ed.,
p. 257), says, &#8220;Dancing among savages is no mere amusement.&#8221;
He quotes from Robertson&#8217;s <i>America</i> (iv. p. 133)
as follows: &#8220;It is an important occupation, which mingles in
every occurrence of public or private life. If any intercourse
be necessary between two American tribes, the ambassadors
of the one approach in a solemn dance, and present the
calumets or emblem of peace; the sachems of the other
receives it with the same ceremony. If war is denounced
against an enemy, it is by a dance expressive of the resentment
which they feel, and of the vengeance which they
meditate. If the wrath of their gods is to be appeased, or
their beneficence to be celebrated; if they rejoice at the birth
of a child, or mourn the death of a friend&#8212;they have dances
appropriate to each of these situations, and suited to the
different sentiments with which they are animated. If a
person is indisposed, a dance is prescribed as the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_526" id="PageII_526">[526]</a></span>
effectual means to restore him to health; and if he himself
cannot endure the fatigue of such an exercise, the physician
or conjurer performs it in his name, as if the virtue of his
activity could be transferred to his patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir J. Lubbock mentions some special dances practised
among different peoples, and gives an illustration of a circle
dance practised by the natives of Virginia round a circle of
upright stones (p. 268).</p>

<p>Dr. Tylor (<i>Anthropology</i>, p. 296) says, &#8220;Savages and
barbarians dance their joy and sorrow, love and rage, even
their magic and religion. The forest Indians of Brazil, rattle
in hand, stamp in one-two-three time round the great earthen
pot of intoxicating kawi-liquor; or men or women dance a
rude courting dance, advancing in lines with a kind of primitive
polka step; or the ferocious war-dance is performed by armed
warriors in paint. We have enough of the savage left in us
to feel how Australians leaping and yelling at a corrobboree
by firelight in the forest can work themselves up into frenzy
for next day&#8217;s fight. But with our civilised notions it is not
so easy to understand that barbarians&#8217; dancing may mean still
more than this; it seems to them so real, that they expect it to
act on the world outside. Such an example as the buffalo
dance (given <i>ante</i>, <a href="#PageII_518">p. 518</a>) shows how, in the lower level of
culture, men dance to express their feeling and wishes. All
this explains how in ancient religion dancing came to be one of
the chief acts of worship. Religious processions went with
song and dance to the Egyptian temples, and Plato said all
dancing ought to be thus an act of religion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Modern
civilisation has mostly cast off the sacred dance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To see
this near its old state the traveller may visit the temples of
India, or among the Lamas of Tibet watch the mummers in
animal masks dancing the demons out or the new year in, to
wild music of drums and shell-trumpets. Remnants of such
ceremonies come down from the religion of England before
Christian times are still sometimes to be seen in the dances
of boys and girls round the midsummer bonfire or mummers
of Yuletide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Tylor continues: &#8220;At low levels in civilisation it is clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_527" id="PageII_527">[527]</a></span>
that dancing and play-acting are one. The scenes of hunting
and war furnish barbarians with subjects for dances, as when
the Gold Coast negroes have gone out to war and their wives
at home dance a fetish dance in imitation of battle to give their
absent husbands strength and courage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Historians trace
from the sacred dances of ancient Greece the dramatic art of
the civilised world. Thus from the festivals of the Dionysia
arose tragedy and comedy. In the classic ages the players&#8217; art
divided into several branches. The pantomimes kept up the
earliest form, where the dancers acted in dumb show such
pieces as the labours of Herakles, or Kadmos sowing the
dragons teeth, while the chorus below accompanied the play
by singing the story. The modern pantomime ballets which
keep up remains of these ancient performances show how grotesque
the old stage gods and heroes must have looked in their
painted masks. In Greek tragedy and comedy the business of
the dancers and chorus were separated from that of the actors,
who recited or chanted each his proper part in the dialogue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grimm (<i>Teutonic Mythology</i>, i. p. 43), says, &#8220;Easter fires,
May Day fires, Midsummer fires, with their numerous ceremonies,
carry us back to heathen sacrifices, especially such
customs as rubbing the sacred flame, running through glowing
embers, throwing flowers into the fire, baking and distributing
loaves or cakes, and the circular dance. Dances passed into
plays and dramatic representations.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is then clear that dances accompanied with song and pantomimic
action have been used by men and women from the
earliest period of which we have record, at all times and upon
all occasions. In times of joy and mirth, sorrow and loss,
victory or defeat, weddings and funerals, plagues and pestilences,
famine and plenty, civilised and savage alike dance, act,
and sing their griefs and their joys. The gods of all nations
have been worshipped by pantomimic dance and song, their
altars and temples are encircled by their worshippers; and as
the occasion was one of fear or joy, and the god entreated or
terrified by his followers, so would the actions and voices of
the dancers be in accord. When once certain actions were
recognised as successful, fitting, or beautiful, they would tend<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_528" id="PageII_528">[528]</a></span>
to become repeated and stereotyped, and the same form would
be used for other gods, other occasions, and other customs
where the requirements were similar or the same. The circle
dance, for instance, after being performed several times would
necessarily become a part of the religious customs or ceremony,
and form a part of the ordinary religious observance. It would
become particularly associated with the place where it was first
instituted, and might be used to inaugurate other festivals.
We know that the early Christians when taking over to their
use the temples and altars of their so-called heathen predecessors,
or when erecting a church where a temple had previously
stood, held their worship there and performed their dances to
their God as the heathens had done to theirs. The custom of
encircling a church on its festival day existed until lately in
several parishes in England, and this could only be a descendant
of the custom once held sacred by all the followers of one belief,
demonstrating by their action in group form the fact that they
all believed in the same thing and held together, by the clasp
of hands and the dance round, their determination to hold to
and keep to it.</p>

<p>If these customary dances obtained and have survived in
religious ritual to the present day, is it not to be expected that
we should find survivals in dance form of non-religious customs
which also impressed themselves strongly on the minds of the
people? Births, marriages, deaths, the sowing and gathering in
of the crops; the protection of cattle from disease and animals
of prey; the necessity for water and fire; the protection of
the house and the village&#8212;have all helped to surround these
events with ceremonials which have lasted, and been transmitted
from generation to generation, altering to suit later
ideas, it is true, but preserving through all some trace of the
events which first called them into existence.</p>

<p>It is because of this tendency to believe more in the power
of expression by action, than in the power of expression by
language alone, that dramatic action and gesture have formed
such a necessary part of representation of custom as to become
an integral part of it. Limited as is our knowledge of the
popular plays performed about the country by troops of strolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_529" id="PageII_529">[529]</a></span>
players before the age of the written play, we know that
their chief attraction must have been the dramatic rendering of
characters and events personified by certain well-known actions
of the actors, accompanied by special style of dress, or portions
of dress, which were recognised as sufficient in themselves to
show who and what was being personified. The story was
shown more by action than by words; the idea being to
present events to the onlooker, and impress them on his mind.
It is in these dramatic performances of what was expected we
have the germs of the dramatic art that afterwards developed
into the regular play or drama. Every important custom of
life was probably depicted by pantomimic action. We have,
first, words, describing the events, sung or said by a chorus of
onlookers and dancers, afterwards a short dialogue between
the chief characters taking the place of the chorus, and then,
as the number of characters were increased, the representations
become something that could be performed independently,
without the need of a particular season or custom to render it
intelligible.</p>

<p>At this stage of the primitive drama the characters merely
present actions of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> time after time, always
performed in the same manner, and this would produce conventional
methods of presenting certain events. We know
that events of a religious nature were presented in the same
manner by the Church. This must have been in consequence
of the attraction plays possessed as depicting pagan religion
and events of ordinary life and manners and customs. It is
easily conceivable that before the era of books and literature, a
rough sort of presentation of life, present and past, would be
eagerly welcomed; and it would not be until the advent of a writer
who developed the individual acting, at the expense of the
event depicted, that what we know as a play could be written.</p>

<p>Mr. Ordish, in his study of Folk drama, published in the Folk-lore
Society&#8217;s journal, has conclusively proved the development
of the drama independently of the miracle and mystery plays of
the Middle Ages, or from the old Greek plays, and this development
has taken place through the action of the people, always
accustomed to the influence of dramatic representation. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_530" id="PageII_530">[530]</a></span>
in the remains of the traditional games we have preserved a
form in which we can see the beginning and early development
of the drama. When once the line form was firmly established
as an indication of two opposite parties, it would be used for
such indication wherever it was required, and thus it became
the common property of the children&#8217;s game and the early
stage. The remains of the line and circle form, as denoting
opponents and friendly communion can, I think, be traced in
old plays and old methods of acting.</p>

<p>In old pantomimes, the demons or evil spirits and their
followers enter on one side and stand in lines; the good fairy
and her followers enter on the opposite side and stand in line;
the principal characters advance from the line, and talk defiance
to each other. We do not have a circle form on the stage, but
a half-circle, seated on the stage, is or was until comparatively
lately a method of representing a social or family party.
Every one who has seen a mummer&#8217;s play performed, either
in or out of doors, will be aware that the same method obtains
in them&#8212;the performers are all on the stage or stand together
at once, walking forward as each one&#8217;s name is mentioned,
saying his allotted part, and then standing back again, while
the next player has his turn.</p>

<p>The action in these plays has remained in stationary form;
as far as the method goes there has probably been very little
difference in the manner of presenting them for a long period
of time.</p>

<p>These traditional games are valuable, therefore, for the
information they afford in a direction not hitherto thought of,
namely, in the study of the early drama. If the drama can be
seen in its infancy anywhere, surely it can be seen in these
children&#8217;s plays.</p>

<p>The study of children&#8217;s games takes us, therefore, into
several departments of research. Many traces of customs
that do not belong to modern life, customs that take us back
to very early times indeed, are brought before us. The
weapons are bows and arrows, the amusements hunting and
hawking; animals are found in such close relationship with
human beings, that only very primitive conditions of life would<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_531" id="PageII_531">[531]</a></span>
allow: contests between men and women occur in such a way
that we are taken back to one of the earliest known customs of
marriage, that known as marriage by capture&#8212;then from this
stage to a later, where purchase or equivalent value obtains;
then to a marriage with a ceremony which carries us back to
the earliest forms of such ceremonies. That such customs can
be suggested in connection with these games goes far to prove
that they, in fact, originate the game&#8212;that no other theory
satisfactorily accounts for all the phenomena.</p>

<p>In looking for the motive power which has caused the continuity
of these customs to be practised as amusements, we
have found that the dramatic power inherent in mankind supplies
the necessary evidence, and from this stage we have been
led to an interesting point in the early history of the drama and
of the stage. It is not, therefore, too much to say that we
have in these children&#8217;s games some of the oldest historical
documents belonging to our race, worthy of being placed side
by side with the folk-tale and other monuments of man&#8217;s progress
from savagery to civilisation.</p>

<p><b>General:</b><br />

This is Volume II of a two-volume work. Because Volume I was published in 1894 and Volume II in 1898, there is no symmetry in the references between the two volumes (for example, Gled Wylie from Volume I does not refer to Shue-Gled-Wylie from Volume II, whereas Shue-Gled-Wylie does refer to Gled Wylie).<br />
In the chapter Addenda the author has added to the description of some of the games. Where this is the case, a hyperlink <sup>[Addendum]</sup> has been provided. Some descriptions have more than one addition; in these cases, there is a separate hyperlink for each addendum.<br />
This eBook contains a number of symbols and characters that may not display properly, depending on the software used and its settings.<br />
Midi files have been provided to play the tunes. Playing these files may not work on all devices, depending on the hard- and software used.<br />
The tables with analyses of the rhymes have been re-arranged to better convey their meaning; they are sometimes very wide and may require horizontal scrolling, depending on the hard- and software used for reading.<br />
This text follows the original printed work, including inconsistencies. Inconsistencies include differences in spelling of the names of games and locations, differences in transcription of dialect, inconsistencies in lay-out, etc. Where changes were made, these are documented below. </p>

<p><b>References and hyperlinks:</b><br />
The book contains some uncertain references to games, because of inconsistent naming and/or spelling of game names. Where these differences were trivial (for example, Wolf and Lamb versus Wolf and the Lamb), their identity has been assumed silently. Following is a list of less trivial references and hyperlinks.<br />
The game Stag is often referred to as Stag Warning; occasionally they are listed as thought they were separate games. The hyperlinks point to Stag.</p>
<ul class="tn">
<li>Page xiv: Lubin, Looby Loo is listed as game in the Additions, but not present there; Hulla-balloo-ballee is not listed, but present in Addenda (including references to Lubin and Looby Loo). The link from Lubin, Looby Loo therefore points to Hulla-ballo-ballee.</li>
<li>Page 56: reference to the Scottish version. From the text and the analysis this is probably version XVIII, to which the hyperlink points.</li>
<li>Page 145: reference to Tag. This game is not listed as such, but according to the description it could be a version of French Jackie (Vol. I), which is called French Tag in some places; the hyperlink points to French Jackie.</li>
<li>Page 282: reference to See the Farmer Sow his Seed, which is not a separate game, but one version of Oats and Beans and Barley, to which the hyperlink points.</li>
<li>Page 307 and 421: reference to Twos and Threes, which is not a separate game, but a local name for Round Tag (where the hyperlink points).</li>
<li>Page 383: reference to Silly Young Man, which is probably a typo for Silly Old Man (where the hyperlink points).</li>
<li>Page 436: reference to "Jolly Lads"; this is not a separate game, the hyperlink points to Jolly Sailors (Vol. I).</li>
<li>Page 467: reference to Drummer Man; there is no such game in either volume, the only Drummer Man occurs in one of the variants of Follow my Gable (Vol. I; the hyperlink points there).</li>
<li>Page 470: reference to Lugs; there is no such game listed, possibly this should be Luggie (Vol. I; hyperlink points there).</li>
<li>Page 476: reference to Old Widow; there is no such game listed, it could be a reference to Poor Widow (the hyperlink points there); Baste the Bear, ditto; this is mentioned under Badger the Bear (Vol. I); Old Woman, ditto, this is hyperlinked to Dumb Motions (Vol. I).</li>

<p><b>Textual remarks:</b><br />
At least some quotations presented by the author are not verbatim quotations, they have been edited by the author (for example Aubrey on cockle-bread).<br />
In the Addenda, the original work uses Arabic rather than Roman numerals for different variants; this has not been changed.<br />
The original work uses both 2-4 and <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to indicate musical time; this has not been standardised.</p>
<ul class="tn">
<li>Page 199: Love another like sister and brother is probably a mistake (Love one another like sister and brother).</li>
<li>Page 336/7: The original work does not give a source or authority for variation XXV.</li>

<p><b>Changes made to original text:</b><br />
Footnotes have been moved to end of the description of the game or (in the Memoir) to immediately underneath the relevant paragraph.<br />
Sources (when printed in smaller type in the original work) have been moved to a separate line where necessary.<br />
In the Addenda, the references to games have been moved to separate lines.</p>

<p><b>Notes on the music transcriptions:</b></p>
<ul class="tn">
<li>Page 26 (Oranges and Lemons, London): Final refrain, measures 25 and 26&mdash;there is something wrong with the beat count in these measures&mdash;they are <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>th note short. Either the terminal 16<sup>th</sup> notes should be 8<sup>th</sup> notes or there is a missing rest; the latter has been added.</li>
<li>Page 68 (Pretty Little Girl of Mine, Hanbury): In the sixth bar, there is a quaver printed as if it were a grace note but after the minim on beats 3 and 4. That and the fact that it has a downwards stem suggests that this is not a grace note but a quaver at the end of the bar for an alternative version of the bar (perhaps to fit the words in one of the verses). This is recorded in the second version, where instead of a minim D as the last two beats of bar 6, a crotchet D followed by a quaver rest and then the quaver on D have been inserted.</li>
<li>Page 102 (Queen Mary): Verses 3, 4 and 5 are quite different to verses 1 and 2. The midi file plays all five verses in sequence.</li>
<li>Page 122 (Round and Round the Village, Barnes): Bar two has a quaver rest at the end. This leaves the bar half a beat short. The quaver rest has been replaced with a crotchet rest, also in the fourth bar. (Round and Round the Village, Hanbury): At the end of the first, third and fifth bars, there is an alternative version of the last note. For example in the first bar it is either a quaver or two semiquavers (possibly to fit the words of different verses). In the midi file, the tune is played first with the longer note and then repeated with the shorter notes.</li>
<li>Page 150 (Sally Water, Beddgelert): The note in bars 4, 8, 16 and the last bar looks as if it were a breve. They have been transcribed as semi-breves. The ninth bar is short of two beats, containing just one minim. The piece contains 28 bars broken into phrases of 4 or 8 bars with this ninth bar so it appears to be required. The transcription given is a minim G which seems to fit well.</li>
<li>Page 185 (See-Saw): Bar 2 is short of an eighth of a beat. The last quaver has been dotted to make this up, mirroring the last dotted quaver in the final bar.</li>
<li>Page 280 (Three Little Ships, Rimbault): The second note in the third and fourth bars appears to be a semi-quaver. This would leave a semi-quaver short in each of these bars. This has been made up by dotting the first quaver.</li>
<li>Page 315 (Twelve Days of Christmas): In the second full bar, the first quaver needs to be dotted to make up the correct number of beats in the bar. Similarly in the bar before the change of time signature to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>, the quavers have been transcribed as dotted. The music as written is for the first and second verses only with an indication of which bar to repeat for each extra day. To illustrate how this works, the midi file continues to the third verse.</li>
<li>Page 323 (Up the Streets): The fourth and seventh bars are missing two beats. The missing beats have been transcribed as rests.</li>
<li>Page 330 (Wallflowers, Connell Ferry): In the fifth bar, a half beat is missing. An extra quaver B before the last two notes of the bar has been inserted.</li>
<li>Page 362/363 (When I was a Young Girl, Market Drayton): In the fourth full bar, the second note is written as a crotchet but must be a quaver to make the correct number of beats in the bar.</li>
<li>Page 384 (Wind up the Bush Faggot): The instructions are to repeat the section in <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> time as often as required and then follow with the <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> section. In the midi file, the first section in <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> is repeated just once to indicate the pattern, followed by the <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> section.</li>
